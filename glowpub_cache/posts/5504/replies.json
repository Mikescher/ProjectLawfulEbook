Project security at the villa was barely, barely competent to keep things from slipping and Security at the palace, even before you took everybody north this morning, was notably worse. Aspexia thought we could make the best of there being rumors about me, but I'm scryable, and frequently in a room with Keltham, it's actually a terrible idea for Lastwall to think I'm interesting!! Maybe the best of our terrible options at that point but an incredibly massive security failure which everyone was just casually indifferent about! Maillol would have done better, but at the palace he doesn't even really use his brain, because he expects everything to run on stupid games he's not good at. You should have your fucking capital at the Worldwound, is what you should do, nothing less than the dumb ones getting eaten by demons makes people realize they aren't&nbsp;<em>special.&nbsp;</em>Cheliax has been around for eighty years and doesn't know how to punish people in a way that makes them better at their jobs, what are we&nbsp;<em>doing? Aspexia was the only person who understood how badly we are failing -\"</em></p>",
