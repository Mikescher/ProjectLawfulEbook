It didn't happen naturally when Tallandria tried it, nor when she attempted obvious blind manipulations of 'potential energy surfaces'.&nbsp; Tallandria remembers, and transcripts agree, that Keltham at INT 18 said he couldn't think of any simple way to find crystal structures without advanced technology out of Civilization, specifically generators for ultra-tiny light particles and very fine detectors for those.\"</p>",

Maybe it's something you have no comprehension of. I don't know. I don't care. I have said I'll pay you; I meant it. If I give my word, I'll keep it.

If your deal sounds worse than dying in a fire -- and many, many, many things sound worse than dying in a fire, when they're offered by smug entities that know too much -- then I'll die in a fire instead.

She&rsquo;s asked people separately to figure out what remains in Cheliax that Pineda might care about, and how it might be credibly threatened; early reports say that Pineda's immediate family is dead and unreachable, but one of Pineda's few disciplinary infractions was about granting too much fame to Paxti of Borras, a former classmate, during a sensitive intelligence operation. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s Pineda's her hand or another, we ought not to rely on it for wartime logistics, in case it&rsquo;s then withdrawn; beyond that, any scheme that strengthens Asmodeus strengthens Us.&rdquo; Obviously false, but no one&rsquo;s going to call her on it. &ldquo;Pineda&rsquo;s loyalties will become apparent when we go to war; most loyalties do.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s quite enough on this dangerous topic, time to steer for - &ldquo;Summarize, Timoteu, the state of those preparations.&rdquo;</p>",

And not let that trigger any adverse actions by Her, unless She'd have arrived at the same conclusion by another pathway, so that Keltham is not disadvantaged by his goodness? It's frustrating to Her how often Good seems to feel the need to treat adversarially with Good, but She at least knows better.</p>\r\n<p>Her splinter doesn't fail to note that Keltham's attempted concealment of his gift seems possibly related to Cayden Cailean shutting down Iomedae's spying apparatus in Cheliax.

It is a parameter that also varies within Her paladins, and between those who can and cannot become Her paladins.</p>\r\n<p>If Keltham makes a pact with Ahriman or Charon - if he seeks to travel into the deeper Abyss to treat with the qlippoth - if he becomes harder to see in the ways of those touched by the Outer Gods - or if Keltham chooses some not-really-evil way to make himself Evil or Chaotic, moves within one alignment step of Rovagug - then the splinter of Iomedae will know at once what that means and why. It is a cache hit for Her; there have been times before when people broke with Her and tried the obvious paths for destroying Creation.</p>\r\n<p>The Iomedae-splinter has done Her planning for that contigency in advance.

It has to work, if you sacrifice enough; if you do something as dramatic as throwing away your Goodness or your Law, reality has to see your pain and determination and be moved somehow; it has to be worth something, after you paid so much. Mortals sometimes think like that, when they break with Her.</p>\r\n<p>The Keltham that She saw in vision would not break in that direction. The Keltham that She saw, if he had devised some standard mad wizard-scheme scheme to end Creation, would pause and ask himself \"Why is Creation still here if it's that easy?\", and do more research first. Even if he couldn't rule out every slivered chance at success, he wouldn't chase futilely after tiny chances. Taking into account that later-Keltham made gift to her Church, the Iomedae-splinter strongly estimates that later-Keltham would ask \"If all the people like me joined forces with the Church of Iomedae instead and accumulated our efforts over the years, instead of dying futilely and individually in the pursuit of some tiny chance of destroying Creation, would this in realistic expectation lead to a better outcome?\" and notice that the answer was \"yes\".

But the splinter of Iomedae concerning Herself with these matters puts very low probability that Keltham would try to unleash Rovagug. Losing the one planet where prophecy doesn't function, and where conditions have conspired to enable an unusual number of mortal-descended gods, would be unfathomably costly to Good, and to the inferred interests of Keltham.

Iomedae's splinter doesn't know that any such mathematical insight is <em>possible; </em>but Her cache-hit on that general class of internal question is that, if it were possible for a mortal to destroy all of Creation just by being very clever, it would be Otolmens's domain to notice the mortal in the process of being that clever and squash them.</p>\r\n<p>Her greater self might have spotted the flaw in that cached answer with respect to Keltham, but her lesser self has not.

That's the problem we're facing, and if it were up to me she'd hang for it four or five times.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The thing I was trying to say was, maybe she knows of, I don't know, some unsealed ancient horror -\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If she knew anything real and were actually interested in helping us prevent it she'd tell us what she knew.

You've got to assure them that there's nothing to worry about.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes,\" Jepata snaps, \"someone already said that. I'm working on it. A message to all city watch - the rumors have been examined, they are false, there are no risks to the city, no one in city leadership is departing -\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Departing is dangerous!\" offers Afsel, reorienting to the new priorities. \"The ships might be sunk, Sala might be feeding people into the mouths of pirates -\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Excellent, yes,\" Jepata agrees. \"Departing puts your family in grave danger, what's safe is keeping them home, Sala's claims have been decisively refuted - yes?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Yes,\" everyone agrees.</p>\r\n<p>\"The best way for the populace to be safe from the panic is to remain in their homes.&nbsp; We'll send more of the city guard to the Ascendant Court -\"<br /><br /></p>",

Most of that time is spent quibbling over wording. They don't get many words, and a number of people want a say in what they are. By then, the city guard has been largely deployed to the docks to manage the masses of people desperately trying to board boats; the rumors that are flying assert that everything from Zon-Kuthon to returning Aroden will be showing up, or maybe that the island will be swallowed into Hell.</p>\r\n<p>But that's not to say that it's too late for the announcement. There are many homes whose residents are bitterly fighting over whether to flee or to stay, many people trying to persuade an entrenched relative or agonizing over whether to spend their entire fortune on a Teleport, many people nervously peeking out into the streets and taking the temperature of things. Many people who want to hear from their city government and know what they should do.</p>\r\n<p>The statement eventually agreed upon is, \"Remain in your homes. Sala's claims have been examined and disproven. No danger exists. All deaths have come from panic. Protect your families: stay home.\"</p>\r\n<p>The minute it is approved, it is passed on to a wizard who was able to prepare the Mage's Decree spell in the last half-hour.</p>",
