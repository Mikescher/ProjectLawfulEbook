I would estimate we have perhaps one month's advantage over Osirion, if Keltham settles down and starts teaching there, plus whatever advantages we derive from having many, many more wizards.

The other wing of the project - producing ilani thinkers, for whatever Hell values in us and for the advantages we may have in understanding spy reports from Osirion and identifying new applications of chemistry - merits a more substantial rethinking, since I've yet to invent a version of ilanism that isn't in substantial tension with Asmodeanism.\"</p>",

I didn't allocate enough resources to inventing an immersive set of history, literature and theology for alter-Cheliax two months ago, as soon as we got out of day-to-day emergency mode and had any slack at all. I did a lot of things to a standard where it'd pass immediate inspection, but that was, obviously, <em>something the Conspiracy could do&nbsp;</em>from Keltham's perspective. It would've been worth the costs, though they would've been substantial, of hiring twenty more full-time writers and having an amount of content that was <em>not </em>obviously something the Conspiracy could do. An advantage of the initial Cheliax is basically Taldor plan over the complex alter-Cheliax we ended up going with is that we could've literally just showed him lots and lots of genuine verified Taldor history with some words changed. I knew that at the time, it was part of how I suggested it, but I underappreciated the cost when we started switching away from that. Going even farther back, we should've&nbsp;<em>literally claimed to him he'd landed on the Taldane worldwound contingent and we were a Lawful Neutral country that had nothing to do with Cheliax,&nbsp;</em>but I'd have had to think of that off no context in the first five minutes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I had concluded tropes weren't real or weren't operative, after Keltham had some nice healthy romances with no elaborate backstories behind them, after he himself concluded that, after it became obvious he was nowhere near kinky enough for Pilar and all the reasoning from her being a 'romantic option' wasn't right. Tropes - are real and are operative, aren't they. If I'd noticed&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>I wouldn't've&nbsp;<em>announced the yearlong pause plan aloud to anyone until Keltham was safely petrified.\"</em></p>",

It is no concern of ours, if other peoples want other things, so long as they're the kind of people who deal fairly; in a sense that's why dealing fairly is so important, because it permits us to grow wealthier alongside entities very alien to us with concerns very different from ours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If an entity dies and goes to Hell because someone falsely told them that Hell was a really nice afterlife where they'd have a lovely time, that is anathema to Abadar. If they die and go to Hell because someone truthfully told them that you go to Hell if you murder lots of people, but they really wanted to murder lots of people, because they valued the products of those murders more than they disvalued going to Hell - fine.

A Will save protects against it. There are magic items of it; they're not even that expensive, though they also wouldn't read anyone powerful who was trying not to be read.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Mindcontrolling magic: oh boy is there a horrifying variety. There's Suggestion, and Triggered Suggestion which you don't remember until you hit the cue for it, and Demand which is Sending with a concealed Suggestion, and Lesser Geas for binding someone to obey your orders for days at a time, and Geas which works on more powerful people, and Dominate Person which lets you puppet someone else at unlimited range as long as you're on the same plane as they are, and see through their eyes, and spells that cause permanent disorientation and the inability to reliably act on your intentions, and Euphoric Tranquility which does what it sounds like, and Overwhelming Presence which makes everyone who enters your presence prostrate themselves on the floor convinced they're in the presence of a god.</p>\r\n<p>Baleful Polymorph renders you permanently a mindless animal.</p>\r\n<p>There's memory modification.</p>\r\n<p>There's a reference to a ninth circle spell that turns you into a book of all of the thoughts you've ever had, and lets people read and edit them, though it's in a work of fiction and it's not clear if the spell is a real thing or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The best protection against mind control, outside an artifact helmet like the Crown of Infernal Majesty, is the spell Mind Blank, which is eighth circle so good luck if you're not an eighth circle caster and don't have one to make you scrolls or cast it for you. Protection from Evil helps against mind control from Evil creatures and casters. Enchantment Foil helps in general, as does Spell Immunity. Nondetection, which also comes in an amulet, is useful against divinations unless the person casting them is very powerful.</p>\r\n<p>A lot of adventurers at least in these works of historical fiction seem to deliberately pass through an antimagic area routinely just so they can notice if any spells fucking with them are active, though that won't detect past memory modification and requires there being one around. (Some wizarding academies have them for research reasons, and there's apparently several hundred square miles of wasteland where magic doesn't work as a consequence of an ancient war.)</p>",

A society that is inhospitable to people like Telcar is more likely to be making errors that being Telcar prevents.

Abrogail is not more merciful than that; wanting more mercy than that would be unAsmodean, and offering it would be <em>very&nbsp;</em>unAsmodean.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Carissa is grateful, for whatever not-merciful impulse has her here, instead. Her mortal mind, which is very stupid and pathetic, does not fully comprehend how much worse it could be, but that is an error, the kind of error she can actually feel herself growing out of when she has time to work on being more ilani.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She is also grateful that there is no opportunity for her to think, or feel, or grieve. In the absence of space to process it, the part of her brain that believes that Keltham loves her and won't let anyone hurt her has taken up residence in the back of her head, where it occasionally whimpers sadly, like a kicked puppy. She has mostly successfully pushed his blank, lost, bewildered face out of her memory. It is over; it never was; it was always pretend. Maybe someday it will be real, but if it is, it will be real the way Hell is real, the way pain is real, the way nothing else is really real.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She's making fast progress on the headband. She would not say that this is because she is in peak form. She keeps having auditory hallucinations, usually of Abrogail, sometimes of her mother, sometimes just of people screaming. Abrogail says that she is not good enough to become half the things she wants to be. Her mother says that she should've worked harder on baby Carissa, that maybe she could've turned out better. The screaming people don't really have anything to say. She <em>thinks</em> she's not constantly screaming, her voice would give out, so probably that's a hallucination. She's developed a habit of hurting herself to focus; it's barely even pain, next to the punishments after each section, but it helps. it makes the world a little more stable, a little clearer. She wishes, sometimes, that Keltham had never come to Golarion, that she'd never left the Worldwound, though this is a stupid thing to wish because these weaknesses were still a part of her and would still have to be burned out of her, and it could, in fact, hurt more than this.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She does not wish to be turned into a statue, not even briefly. She is pretty sure she won't even if, when she finishes the headband, they give her another one. She is pretty sure she won't even if there is nothing else for the rest of time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She's only pretty sure, though.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>No.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She's entirely sure.</p>\r\n<p>This is the road to everything she wants, everything she's ever wanted; she is not so weak that, with that road laid out in front of her, she will fall apart rather than walk it, just because it hurts. If she wants to change things, she will have to be stronger than anyone has ever been; this is the way to get there. Abrogail will have set her a task that makes stronger those Carissae who could ever, possibly, be strong enough to get anything they want. Abrogail has never made her weaker; Abrogail is not, at what must be unimaginable expense, setting her to this path so that she'll discover her weakness and collapse of it. Abrogail is doing this so that she will grow strong.</p>",

      "content": "<p>\"The Pharaoh is intended to give Abadar what the once-mortal gods have - an aspect which can comprehend and communicate directly with mortals, when it's worth the cost. Theologically speaking, we teach that the Pharaoh is Abadar, as much as any facet of a god is that god - a very specialized facet, obviously, because this particular facet is run on a mortal mind, and sometimes it's more aspirational than concrete, but the idea is that Abadar having the capacities of the mortal gods is very valuable both to Him and to us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As such, we learned three months ago that a mortal in Chelish custody was a very new soul with impressive knowledge and comprehension of Abadar's domain and what He cares about, a comprehension Abadar didn't think He'd seen among mortals before, and that Abadar had paid Asmodeus to not mind control that mortal and to let that mortal leave freely, and very shortly after that that a godwar had started over that mortal. The Pharaoh was subject to the interdict, as an aspect of Abadar, and while we did run a small department which could in theory have learned of your presence in Osirion via a non-Abadar route and enabled us to try an extraction, they didn't get there through information that wasn't downstream of any divine communication.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, we got a spy report out of Cheliax that was, frankly, very confusing and that we assumed was mostly made up. The claim was made that if anyone in the Palace in Egorian had anything good happen to them, a girl with vivid pink hair would show up and offer them cake. - this was among many other claims, like that every devil in Hell knew the name of the Project Lawful girls, and that Project Lawful turned people into girls, and that Project Lawful was a time travel project to convert Taldor to Asmodeanism thousands of years ago, that were similarly not credible. But the cake one was cheap to test, so we tested it. Send someone whose wife was imminently expecting a baby to an inn just outside the palace, to celebrate. Cake Girl indeed showed up, at the appointed time. - we intended to kidnap her and offer her money to defect. She was a powerful spellcaster, and shrugged that off, and ate the cake with us, and left.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At that point we gave all the rumors of Project Lawful substantially more credence. At the same time, bidding markets in Hell were sending a specific set of souls up to extraordinary prices. We looked into it. We pieced together much of what was going on - though the group that had no knowledge of Abadar's interests here did not have enough information to conclude this was worth provoking a war with Cheliax over, and recommended against.</p>\r\n<p>Abadar communicates mostly with the pharaoh. He can do so more cheaply, and there are precisions to His visions which it's best for the pharaoh to have firsthand. But one thing Abadar can do relatively cheaply, and convey relatively cheaply, is see markets. So He's been keeping me updated with the bid-ask spreads from the project's public-to-you and secret-from-you prediction markets, and I've been responsible for figuring out everything happening on Project Lawful and preparing Osirion for the time when you'd learn the truth and leave.\"</p>",

This might change if our spies in Cheliax indicate they're making more progress than we thought they could.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We're arranging to have groups of researchers from other countries immigrate to pick up the Prestidigitation techniques themselves, negotiating details with Ione now, so that the set of free people working on this is larger than Cheliax's, though we're trying to do that very quietly right now, so as not to provoke a countermove.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our best guess about what's going to happen is that Cheliax is going to be faster to start benefitting from very very cheap spellsilver, because they had three months' head start, and they'll have a tough call to make soon about whether to try to leverage an eroding initial advantage into some conquest or into being harder for the rest of the world to roll over. I don't know how they'll navigate that. Going to war with us is a reasonably likely possibility; so is withdrawing from the Worldwound so the rest of the world has to scramble to recommit forces we don't really have and logistics networks we haven't built there. Iomedae's been trying to prepare for that possibility; Her Church hasn't actually told us what specifically the plan is, but I think there are several of them and it's not a one-stroke winning move for Cheliax even if it'll be a very costly problem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the longer run, once you've recovered, we want to pay you to improve our curriculum for teaching the principles of Law to the general public and to teach us on disease control and crop yields and textile manufacture and economics and whatever else people want to pay you the most to teach because it seems the most valuable.\"</p>",

There are prostitutes, they're not illegal, but there's not many, and you certainly can't bring them to parties, and they're not a very appealing substitute for a long-term romantic relationship. So if a man wants a serious relationship, and regular access to a woman's bed, he'd better make himself a good candidate for marriage and then go persuade someone to marry him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Marriage is a lifelong commitment. A man promises to provide for his wife and for any children she bears him, to pay for treatment if she's sick within whatever his abilities are, to provide her with a home and protect her and her children from danger, and to greet her with love. In return, a woman promises to obey her husband, to steward his money wisely and raise his children well, to be faithful to him and to greet him with love.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some marriages break down, and the couple ends up living separately or barely speaking to each other. But still, they are bound by these promises; and a woman can go to the Osirian state if her husband isn't providing for her family, and get money drawn out of his bank account if he has one, and get him prevented from remarrying.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Because of all this, it's actually very rare, for even a girl-child to be left outside to die of exposure when she's born. You marry someone who can provide for your children, and then your children don't starve; that is the whole promise, here, that if you refrain from recklessly having sex without the safety of marriage then you won't have to watch your children starve.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In Avistan they don't do any of that very much. Some girls will have sex with you even when you haven't married them. Because some girls can do that, no girls can hold out for a lifelong promise to provide for them; why would a man offer them that, when he could just go have sex with all the girls who'll offer it for free? No one would get married, so they made a sort of fake marriage that you can break at any time, and they all do that. Women are, in a sense, freer. They aren't chaperoned. Because no man will provide for them, it's more important for their families to figure out how they'll provide for themselves, so more of them are financially independent, though also many, many more of them starve, or are killed by a man they trusted and shouldn't have, or die of an abortion. Many of them feel that there's something wrong, something missing, that things shouldn't be like this, but those ones simply don't lie with anyone at all; they can't find any men who'd be worth trusting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our society demands virtue of men and virtue of women, and constrains them so that they can't do whatever they like but they won't go hungry. Avistan demands no virtue of anyone, and they do as they like, and they kill the babies that result and then they go to Hell, or Abaddon, or the Abyss, and it just doesn't sound like a very good trade, really. If you say the wrong things about women's liberation people think you're proposing they raise their girls into Avistani whores -- by which I don't even mean they pay for sex, just that they offer it outside of marriage -- and they'll hate that idea and stop listening to you.\"</p>",

He believed, apparently with complete sincerity, that the two went hand in hand, that the chemistry was a byproduct of the math-inspired form of social organization, though it was invented back in his society's screened-off history. As a result, Cheliax set its people not just to learning chemistry but also to trying to master his world's math-inspired form of social organization.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This was a mistake.</p>\r\n<p><br />It's not that being interested in the math-inspired form of social organization was a mistake. Hell seems interested; they all serve Hell; that is enough reason to try to grasp it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But you can also just take the parts that are about how to iterate on chemical processes, and then get really rich and conquer the world. And in terms of order of operations, that one is really the important one. Especially since no one has figured out how the math-inspired form of social organization is compatible with Asmodeanism, while getting really rich and conquering the world is entirely compatible with Asmodeanism.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Asmodia, not that the Lady Avaricia would contemplate criticizing her in the slightest, is obviously one of the major drivers of this mistake. She was the subject of some kind of divine intervention, cementing everyone's sense that she's Very Important. She's not particularly talented at improving industrial processes. She was utterly necessary, while they had Keltham around, because the math-inspired form of social organization was important for lying to people who rely on it. But she's from the beginning conceived of the whole project as being about ilanism, instead of as being about getting rich and conquering the world.</p>\r\n<p>(Much the same could be said of Sevar, but Avaricia does not say it, for it is said, don't criticize your superiors without a plan to take their job, and she has noticed that Sevar's job involves a lot of being personally tortured by the Queen of Cheliax.)</p>",

They have complaints about their lives: Jana's mother-in-law barely gives Jana money for clothes, and saves her the worst portions of food. Jana thinks it's because she's a jealous old hag. Hanifa's husband keeps investing in business ventures he says will pay off one day but have shown no signs of that so far; she's still pleased she married him, because he's very cosmopolitan and hardly demands anything of her, but she's worried they'll be ruined in their old age.</p>\r\n<p>Zaynab's first husband was lost at sea and second husband died last year, of old age; she's too old to marry again, she says, and wouldn't want to anyway, though she is lonely sometimes. She did petition for, and get granted, acknowledgement as the head of her second husband's household, since her only sons were by her first husband. It wasn't very complicated. She told a priest she knew how to do figuring and had a good reputation with their neighbors and never missed church and had deposited savings 40 of the last 50 weeks, and she didn't think there was anyone better for the family until the little children grew up, and he gave her a paper for it.</p>\r\n<p>Jana thinks that men should be told in church to want sex less often, as it's burdensome for their wives. Lamiya thinks that the schools should feed boys; otherwise she can't afford to send them.</p>\r\n<p>All of them think that if Osirion were richer, then things would be better. None of them have problems they'd still have if they were rich, as they see it.</p>\r\n<p>Zaynab argues, in response to hypotheticals about neutral-gender laws, that if Cheliax kills half of all Osirion's&nbsp;<em>men&nbsp;</em>the country will bounce right back in a generation, but if it kills half of all Osirion's women that can't really be recovered from, and so a country that sent women off to war will gradually be conquered by places that didn't.&nbsp;</p>",

He is also a great proponent of peace, as war inevitably leads to the degradation of trade and the stifling of prosperity for the general public. He advocates cautious, careful consideration in all matters, and frowns on impulsiveness, believing that it leads to the encouragement of primitive needs. Abadar discourages dependence on government or any religious institution, believing that wealth and happiness should be achievable by anyone with keen judgement, discipline, and a healthy respect for all sensible, just laws.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Abadar is not one of the gods with a track record of adopting specific pet humans He then makes absurd sacrifices for, though some gods do do that; Aroden seemed to have particularly close and sustained attachments to the greatest among His mortal followers, and a number of them He eventually promoted to demigods or similar before Iomedae, of course, attained full godhood in Her own right. The first time Abadar has bestowed attention, power and mentorship on mortals in some form other than promoting them as His priests or sending them visions is the current situation in Osirion.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>During the Age of Creation, Abadar was among the original gods who battled the Rough Beast who sought to destroy Golarion. According to the Windsong Testaments, after Gorum and Torag forged the shell of the Dead Vault, Abadar provided the perfect key and lock for Rovagug's prison, a key so cunningly made that only Asmodeus could turn it.</p>\r\n<p>Abadar is credited with guiding the advancement of humanoid races towards the point where they could establish civilized societies of their own.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The general understanding of the Osirion situation is that the end of prophecy made it necessary for Abadar to have the ability to pay mortals to do what He wants, if He's going to get any of His goals achieved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The context in which Abadar's best understood to do things people think of as <em>sentimental</em> is the First Vault. The story goes that the first time a mortal made, with their own hands, something of value to them, He was delighted, and when it was lost to the general difficulties of life in that time, He was horrified, and He made the vault so that the work of peoples' hands and minds would never be lost forever. Depending on the source, He may or may not let some people go in and get treasured things once they die.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Abadar strives to maintain agreeable relationships with the other deities, recognizing their influence is conducive to the further advancement of civilized life. In particular, he cultivates alliances with Iomedae, Irori, Shelyn, Asmodeus, and Erastil. Gozreh often opposes Abadar's actions, though Abadar only recognizes Rovagug and Lamashtu as true enemies. The god Aroden respected Abadar and consulted Abadar's The Manual of City-Building to aid in his establishment of the country of Taldor and of the city-state of Absalom. Abadar once opened channels to the archdevil Mephistopheles to cement an alliance based on the archdevil's interest in contracts but these negotiations failed.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>No one really understands how the once-human gods relate to the never-human gods. There are vague half-references to Aroden having tried to make some arrangements before He ascended, before giving up and becoming a god. The once-human gods are definitely much weaker than the never-human ones; it's unclear if that's somehow intrinsic to being once-human, or the product of a negotiated agreement or just a temporary state of affairs because the once-human gods are weaker or what.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Abadar was worshiped by the ancient Azlanti before Earthfall, who focused more on his aspects as a god of cities and gold, rather than of law. As the Azlanti built their first towns and sought others to trade with, he saw his cult spread and taught them to establish cities and seek more wealth. When the Azlanti became an empire, Abadar's faith became popular among merchants and politicians.</p>\r\n<p>Abadar's church turned economy and finances into an academic school. Many temples served as vaults where the church's and the empire's wealth resided, and the government provided significant military and security support to the church. As the empire expanded, Abadar's church founded hundreds of cities and established trade across all colonies, and turned the formation of a stable economy and a network of merchants who could carry goods and currency across the entire empire into an art.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

The objective of Project Lawful is to use true Asmodeanism, the things Hell is forbidden to teach us, to invent the means to conquer the world. Most of the conquest of the world will be achieved with chemistry, the knowledge of the minute physical details of reality that enables alchemical reactions we didn't previously know how to attain, and with related principles of shareable experimentation. Alchemists conduct plenty of experiments, but <em>alchemy</em> is hardly richer for them; the benefits accrue to the individual, and not to Cheliax, which is their master and which merits the greater share of the benefit from their discovery. Dath ilan figured out how to ensure that experimentation benefits the state and not just the experimenter, and we'll be doing that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;In dath ilan, where this chemistry was first discovered, every child is raised from a young age with a grasp of the mathematical foundations of what they do and why. Keltham attempted to teach that to us, out of some kind of conviction that there was where the true secret of dath ilan's wealth and power lay. The mathematical foundations of the universe are certainly interesting, but where they bore fruit was in the areas I have spoken of -- chemistry, and experimental methods for ensuring that Cheliax can prosper by the discoveries of its alchemists. Had we the luxury of all the time in the world, it would fall to us to attempt to coax the other elements of Keltham's teaching to bear fruit.</p>\r\n<p>But we have no such time. Keltham has fled to Osirion, where he will be teaching eager Abadarans all he knows, and warning all the world that Cheliax has cheap spellsilver and knowledge of the principles to invent more from there. The war is coming soon, and if we are unprepared for it we will be annihilated, by the self-righteous forces of Good that loathe any power that does not bow to them. You will not have the luxury of mastering ilanism in a meandering way from all its foundations dath ilan teaches to children; you will master chemistry quickly and cleanly, you will learn the experimental methods, and all the rest of ilanism we will develop as necessary to enable further achievements in industry. The core problem before you is how to make spellsilver cheaper to make, and possible to make without the attention of high level wizards, and how to use alchemy to cause much larger explosions, and to prevent them.</p>\r\n<p>Along the way, some of the tangential bits of ilanism will prove necessary to master, and you'll be trained in them, but we are not trying to do Hell's work. We are trying to defend our lives, our souls, and our homeland, and if Asmodeus wills it we'll learn more about the deep true nature of the world along the way, because we require it for His service.\"</p>",

I know what I see, and I can make some inferences from that, but I don't have the whole picture any more than you do. What I see is: we are going to lose if Keltham sets up in Osirion to invent weapons to deploy against us. We can't get there that fast ourselves. I thought we might invade Osirion the day they took him; why give them any more time to be ready? We didn't. One possibility is that it's worth the delay to wrap up in Nidal first, but Nidal's going to be a liability at least for a couple of years and we don't have that long. Another likely-looking possibility is that plans are underway to assassinate and soultrap Keltham in the next week or two. Then we're not fighting Keltham, and we're just trying to conquer the world against the world's inevitable, half-assed efforts to coordinate against that. The third possibility is that in the assessment of our superiors, Keltham won't actually be able to make headway in Osirion and won't stop Cheliax from growing in power.</p>\r\n<p>We aren't going to invent weapons good enough to be decisive in a war that happens in the next few months. I notice that you're not even working on weapons at all, and I do suspect that's because you're a traitor. So the question is which of the projects happening here has the most potential to turn into a valuable contributor to Cheliax's conquest of a Keltham-free, or Keltham-ineffectual, Golarion.</p>\r\n<p>Cheliax is expanding spellsilver production, and I expect they think that Sevar, even if she comes back broken, won't come back too broken to make her little item manufacture aids. Soon we'll control territory we've never held even in our glory days - Nidal - and we'll be rich beyond the imaginings of our ancestors, and our soldiers will be well enough armed and equipped to achieve whatever objectives they're next pointed at.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>From the fact that our superiors did not tell us to run this project like we're Lastwall, or even like we're Osirion, and from the fact Sevar is being tortured horribly for a length of time that people really don't come back from, I think they're not too impressed with the progress made under Sevar's leadership. I can only assume that's why they're entertaining all you unbearable teenagers. And friction like this does give people the chance to demonstrate that they're either competent to operate in Cheliax, or that they aren't; that's worth a couple lost days, under some assumptions about how we win here.</p>\r\n<p>You're not supposed to break, Asmodia. You're supposed to grow up. You're not supposed to put up with self-destructive behavior; you're supposed to punish it. You're not supposed to squabble with Avaricia like a couple of five year olds yelling 'not me, you!', you're supposed to crush her. This is a test, and I think they have those in dath ilan.\"</p>",

So far, as people have become more prosperous, more of them have been Evil. This is confusing; you'd think that one of the things an agent would purchase with more prosperity is their preferred afterlife. Abadar's theories include that people prefer the Evil afterlives, that people prefer other things they can buy even though those things cause them to go to the Evil afterlives, or that people are failing to be coherent agents. It's probably the latter. it almost always is.</p>\r\n<p>But at the time, that Keltham would make mortals richer wasn't obvious to Abadar; Abadar considered it a possibility, but expected most utility from Keltham to come from Keltham's understanding of coordination. If the reason that wealth makes mortals Eviller is related to their incompetence at coordination, then if they were more ideal agents they'd be less likely to go to the Evil afterlives, and Keltham would decrease the agents going to the Evil afterlives. Abadar's extrapolation from his own state of knowledge at the time suggests that He would have wrongly expected this effect to dominate the wealth effect He then considered unlikely.</p>\r\n<p>Then there's the question of the resources transfer to Asmodeus; Asmodeus having more resources causes more people to go to Hell, drawing disproportionately but not wholly from the other Evil afterlives, and Abadar has some sense of the exchange rate. Inconveniently this number is within an order of magnitude of the expected effect from Abadar's early state of information from more coherent agents going to the Evil afterlives less.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then there's the question of whether Keltham at the time would predictably oppose people going to the Evil afterlives or the actions of their agents. That Abadar did calculate at the time; he quoted Asmodeus the evidence he'd observed over the prior that Keltham would oppose Asmodeus or Cheliax. Presumably Asmodeus attempted to price that in with respect to Hell, but not with respect to Abaddon or the Abyss. Keltham was at the Worldwound at the time, and most mortals at the Worldwound oppose the Abyss, though not usually through particular opposition to people going to the Abyss, which they mostly don't do as a product of the actions of Chaotic Evil agents with that aim in mind...Abadar thinks this factor will be smaller than the others and can be neglected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So time to return to the first calculations with more of His attention, as they're close enough to matter. Some chance of wealth causing more Evil, some higher chance of coherence causing less Evil, predictable expected Evil caused by Asmodeus....</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Yes</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He says when He's got an estimate He's reasonably confident in.&nbsp;</p>",

I'm Lawful Evil, I obey Asmodeus, I don't mind hurting people, I don't get worked up about how, oh, no, torture, I'd still rather endure a hundred years of it than the twenty minutes of Chaotic Good we've just been subjected to. But I don't like feeling like people are weaker, instead of stronger, when they get hurt, if you don't hit them just right, I don't like the ways that the fear of Hell makes them more pathetic instead of less so - I'm very pathetic, right now, so you can't take any of this as particularly criticism of other people, understand, but I can see it, very clearly, how pathetic everyone is all the time, and I want it to stop, I want people to be like Her Majestrix who it's absolutely illegal to casually call 'Abrogail' by the way, I want to be like that myself, or at least like, a piece that fits in with that, strengthens it, instead of just falling short of it. And Cheliax doesn't produce people like that. It's not really trying, honestly. As long as they go to Hell - and they do go to Hell - it doesn't matter. But it matters to me, and as soon as - we started - I was thinking about how to fix it. I wanted to understand you, I wanted to be like you, it felt like not just everything I'd always wanted from my life but also everything I'd always wanted for the world. Something beautiful, instead of something that we were all - buried under, flinching from.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"I talked with Subirachs, at one point, about how awful it felt to - be doing this to you - I explained that I'd been conceptualizing it as - service to the Lawful Evil Keltham we were hoping to awaken from his Lawful Good upbringing, hoping to make able to understand everything without it breaking him and willing to take it, once he had it. Iiiiii think that like many of my plans was running on willful self-deception but it was how I was thinking of it. I tried - to make as much real as I could - they didn't tell me when you were planning to attack me and drag me off - I ordered everyone else to not pretend with you -</p>\r\n<p>- uh, I did, at one point, on a day you were petrified, have sex with Elias Abarco, I didn't want to, I tried to stop him, and I'm sorry, that I did it and that I didn't tell you even though I couldn't tell you without blowing the whole thing open. Aside from that I actually tried to do what you asked of me, the best I could, and to make sure no one you were sleeping with was - the thing you were so scared we all were -</p>\r\n<p>- I'm not trying to convince you I wasn't incredibly Evil. I was incredibly Evil, I hurt a lot of people. I'm just trying to convince you that I love you, not just in a way where we have feelings we don't know how to describe but in a way where - I tried, to make the thing I was doing bring you joy and not hurt you secretly, except I was lying to myself about everything.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And to be clear, I still am, probably, lying to myself about some things. Since I'm still Chelish, and this is still my project, and I can only achieve any of the things I want to achieve if I manage not to steer myself off any cliffs of heresy in the meantime. I wouldn't - take the things I'm saying right now as particularly right, about what happened. When you come back - if you come back - I think I'll understand it better, and I'll be able to give you a proper confession.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In private. Because this is ludicrous.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"But, uh, the parts I'm sure about are - you were what I needed, and I was very happy, and you were making me stronger, and I loved you, and I still love you, and I'll probably always love you, and I hope some day once you've made whatever determinations you need to make, about what's real and how the world works, you'll come back for me.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He doesn't cry, even then.</p>\r\n<p>Mostly because he was paying attention the first time.</p>",
