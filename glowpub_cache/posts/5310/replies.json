      "content": "<p>Boy howdy betsy-booyah is Carissa using some ideas not natural to the conceptual language of dath ilan.</p>\r\n<p>When Keltham was very young indeed, it was explained to him that if somebody old enough to know better were to deliberately kill somebody, Civilization would send them to the Last Resort (an island landmass that another world might call 'Japan'), and that if Keltham deliberately killed somebody and destroyed their brain, Civilization would just put him into cryonic suspension immediately.</p>\r\n<p>It was carefully and rigorously emphasized to Keltham, in a distinction whose tremendous importance he would not understand until a few years later, that this was not a <em>threat.</em>&nbsp; It was not a promise of&nbsp;<em>conditional </em><em>punishment.</em>&nbsp; Civilization was not trying to&nbsp;<em>extort</em> him into not killing people, into doing what Civilization wanted instead of what Keltham wanted, based on a prediction that Keltham would obey if placed into a counterfactual payoff matrix where Civilization would send him to the Last Resort if and only if he killed.&nbsp; It was just that, if Keltham demonstrated a tendency to kill people, the other people in Civilization would have a natural incentive to transport Keltham to the Last Resort, so he wouldn't kill any others of their number; Civilization would have that incentive to exile him regardless of whether Keltham responded to that prospective payoff structure.&nbsp; If Keltham deliberately killed somebody and let their brain-soul perish, Keltham would be immediately put into cryonic suspension, not to further escalate the threat against the more undesired behavior, but because he'd demonstrated a level of danger to which Civilization didn't want to expose the other exiles in the Last Resort.</p>\r\n<p>Because, of course, if you try to make a threat against somebody, the only reason why you'd do that, is if you believed they'd respond to the threat; that, intuitively, is what the definition of a threat <em>is.</em></p>\r\n<p>It's why Iomedae can't just alter herself to be a kind of god who'll release Rovagug unless Hell gets shut down, and threaten Pharasma with that; Pharasma, and indeed all the other gods, are the kinds of entity who will predictably just ignore that, even if that means the multiverse actually gets destroyed.&nbsp; And then, given that, Iomedae doesn't have an incentive to release Rovagug, or to self-modify into the kind of god who will visibly inevitably do that unless placated.</p>\r\n<p>Gods and dath ilani both know this, and have math for defining it precisely.</p>\r\n<p>Politically mainstream dath ilani are not libertarians, minarchists, or any other political species that the splintered peoples of Golarion would recognize as having been invented by some luminary or another.&nbsp; Their politics is built around math that Golarion doesn't know, and can't be predicted in detail without that math.&nbsp; To a Golarion mortal resisting government on emotional grounds, \"Don't kill people or we'll send you to the continent of exile\" and \"Pay your taxes or we'll nail you to a cross\" sound like threats just the same - maybe one sounds better-intentioned than the other, but they both sound like threats.&nbsp; It's only a dath ilani, or perhaps a summoned outsider forbidden to convey their alien knowledge to mortals, who'll notice the part where Civilization's incentive for following the exile conditional doesn't depend on whether you respond to exile conditionals by refraining from murder, while the crucifixion conditional is there because of how the government expects Golarionites to respond to crucifixion conditionals by paying taxes.&nbsp; There is a crystalline logic to it that is not like yielding to your impulsive angry defiant feelings of not wanting to be told what to do.</p>\r\n<p>The dath ilani built Governance in a way more thoroughly voluntarist than Golarion could even understand without math, not (only) because those dath ilani thought threats were morally icky, but because they knew that a certain kind of technically defined threat wouldn't be an equilibrium of ideal agents; and it seemed foolish and dangerous to build a Civilization that would <em>stop working</em> if people started behaving&nbsp;<em>more rationally.</em></p>\r\n<p>The Taldane word 'punishment' translates into Civilization's conceptual library as a technical concept for a structure that should never appear in reality - not just the punishment itself being kept out of reality; the <em>threat</em> of punishment is something that shouldn't appear in the <em>actual counterfactuals.</em></p>\r\n<p>So \"giving someone orders that they cannot follow, so you can punish them for failing to follow them\" <em>doesn't make any sense even assuming the actualization of a counterfactual threat structure,</em> because&nbsp;<em>punishment</em> is by technical definition something that appears in <em>threats,</em> which, if they're being deployed sanely, are meant to work in a way where the naive agent obeys in actual reality and therefore the threatening agent doesn't have to expend resources on carrying out the punishment in actual reality, so why would you <em>purposefully </em><em>give somebody orders they can't follow,</em> that doesn't even make sense&nbsp;<em>even in the world where threats work on people -</em></p>",

First, I think you probably actually can't damage me for the rest of my pre-afterlife existence, I recognize I'd be more credible on this front if I didn't apparently have some kind of Worldwound-related trauma but I've been there for six years and I'll be astonished if I have trouble relaxing for a&nbsp;month. And that's, you know, watching my friends eaten by demons in front of me and so on, not getting<em> hurt</em>. Second, I'm worried you're still - reaching too much for a trade frame? Which is maybe my fault, for telling you what I like - I am not trading you 'the right to do whatever you want' for 'hopefully it's a satisfactorily compelling experience for me and if not I'll wish I hadn't made the trade'. I am giving you the right - because I have it, and so I have the right to give it away - to do whatever you'd like. If I wanted a very specific range of things to happen to me I could hire my own damn sex worker. You don't owe me 'me not getting damaged', because you don't owe me anything, and I am not, really, honestly not, trying to sneak in some little things you owe me around the sides. It's - would it work any better to say it's an experiment I am doing with myself, and if the result of that experiment is damage then I'd rather have damage happen, like when you're testing artillery you don't want the test to miraculously come out 'no damage', you want the test to accurately reflect field conditions...</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thirdly, it's common to order someone to tell you, if they think they're past what they can handle. Not because you're obliged to stop, not because you're obliged to care at all, but because you, as the person doing exactly as you please, might like more information to aid you in doing exactly as you please.\"</p>",
