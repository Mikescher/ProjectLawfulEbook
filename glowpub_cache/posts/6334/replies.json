Is she, mentally and emotionally, configured in the best possible way to work on this for as long as it takes, alongside Keltham even when everything he says is incredibly frustrating and feels slippery and wrongheaded?</p>\r\n<p><br />No.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />This is hardly a thought that required lifting her mind up to a new stage where most people could hardly recognize it. She talked about it with Carmin on her second day here, when she first needed a break from making her wall of strategically important questions. She'd picked a coping mechanism by then: she was visualizing her thoughts, in her head, as suspended above a river of torment, red-hot like the Andramal winding through Dis. That way, she could identify when a thought was touched, singed, shaped, by the river of agony, and rerun it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />This, Carmin had said, was not the approach most people come up with, to trying to think clearly while in pain; mostly they try to make the pain less intense, less immediate, until it's the kind of pain you can work alongside as an old friend. \"Be in constant emotional agony, use very elevated Wisdom to check if thoughts were touched by the intense emotional agony\" is both not available to most people and not a very good idea.</p>\r\n<p><br />Carissa obediently tried various approaches to being in less emotional agony. She determined that many of them were designed for problems that were not 'the literal worst possible outcome under your values system is very likely to happen and it's your fault' since many of them were about noticing and appreciating how the problem you had was not the worst possible problem to have, or not likely to be very bad, or not very likely to happen, or would leave a world worth living in even if it happened. They would be very useful if she were emotionally distressed about her family going to Hell or something normal to be sad about like that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Most ways of being in less emotional agony involved looking away from reality, and she could afford that even less than she could afford the emotional agony. Most ways of trying to shape her thoughts to dip into the river of agony less often involved shaping her thoughts to not tell her when the river of agony was influencing her, and that was even worse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />So she told Carmin it was the approach where she was in constant emotional agony but learned how to keep her thoughts properly clear of it, or nothing, at least until she was even wiser. She would be sculpted around the pain she was in, but at least she would see it clearly, have no thoughts she couldn't think, and know which thoughts to distrust; that was the best solution she could come up with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<p>That was wrong, of course. The thing she can feel herself doing now was possible even at her previous Wisdom. She actually thinks that one of the fundamental revelations she's having, one of the general principles here, is that all this was possible for the very original Carissa, the little girl at the Worldwound worshipping Asmodeus with no magic at all.</p>\r\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />All she's doing is looking at the pain and knowing that it does not help. That because it does not help, it is a luxury, and she cannot afford luxuries. It feels strange at first, and counterintuitive, for pain to be a luxury, for grief and guilt and horror and misery to be luxuries, but that's what they are; they are parts of Carissa which are real and important and which she cannot afford.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />The pain does not want to hear that it's a luxury. The pain wants to be necessary. The pain wants the story to go that Carissa Sevar is in so much pain and has to do her work anyway. But of course the story is better, truer to the pain and truer to Carissa Sevar, if it goes that Carissa Sevar does not have the luxury of being in pain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />If you do this wrong, you'll just fold the pain up on itself, and be miserable about your own misery, count it against yourself as another failing. Here, she does feel like she's using a skill she didn't have before, a skill that she certainly at least never used before: the skill of reaching for each thread of her mind and knowing how much pressure to put on it, so that it dissolves instead of hiding. It feels vaguely like picking blackberries; you develop a sense of which are ripe on the vine and ready to fall into your hand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />She looks at the pain, thread by thread, and she tells it regretfully that she cannot afford it. That precisely because the thing that she is mourning is so important, there is no space and no time to mourn it, and so she'll have to not be in pain, and that too is part of the tragedy, that she must walk into it without even the comfort of being permitted to grieve it. She does it very gently, very cautiously, so she doesn't just hide her thoughts from herself by accident.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Dath ilan is not really something she wants to see win; dath ilan winning isn't very good, by her values. She suspects it's wrong-by-Carissa's-values to kill demons and magical beasts and wild turkeys and mules. It's definitely wrong to kill anyone who can object.She thinks it's definitely wrong not to make new people, if you can do it. It's all right to hurt people if you're good at it. It's all right to have slaves, if you made them or saved them when no one else would have. That's what a Carissaeish Good would look like, she thinks. She isn't, herself, Carissaeish Good, but if she met a civilization of it she'd want to see them win.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Dath ilan's mental techniques were, in a very ordinary sense, engineered to make people dath ilani; engineered to raise ilani children who share the fundamental assumptions of their society. Every society does that; there's no way of raising children without inculcating them in your values, nor would it be a reasonable thing to try. You can tell them about the importance of independence and thinking for themselves, but that's a value of your society that you are inculcating in them. There's nothing wrong with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Since Carissa disagrees with dath ilan on almost every important values question relevant to her life, she is wary of building her mind out of cognitive techniques meant to produce dath ilani. Even without assuming any malicious engineering by dath ilan's technique engineers to confuse people about their own values, dath ilanism teaches ways of resolving some of the muddles inside people, and Carissa thinks it mostly does not resolve them in the way that a fully worked out Sevarism would resolve them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />If she had time, then, Carissa would discard ilani techniques entirely and build it all herself from scratch. She didn't, initially, agree with this premise of Irorite philosophy, but it has grown on her; the best cognitive techniques for you are the ones you hammered out yourself, at your pace, with your goals as an aim, with access to some examples but without a model you'll get stuck on and use as a base for forming your own.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Of course, she doesn't have time. She needs to become as skilled as possible as quickly as possible, even if this means building a permanently worse and diminished Carissa because of using techniques that aren't hers, that are designed by people that don't share her values, and that resolve all her muddles in the wrong way. It's better to have access to those tools than to not, wherever she's not able to invent her own fast enough. But she thinks that the version of her built out of ilani techniques instead of out of her own techniques she invented herself for her own specific values and purposes will be substantially worse, and so she's trying skill-by-skill to calculate the best tradeoff and then use the ilani technique or not depending how that calculation comes out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />And of course it is not a good use of her energy to feel sad about this, or bitter, or resentful, so she's not going to, but she considers learning dath ilani techniques to be replacing bits of her own soul with aliens with alien priorities, and it is the sort of thing that would grieve her, if she had time to grieve. She doesn't share Keltham's sense that people ought to enhance themselves slowly, bit by bit, filling out the pieces of themselves as they grow - it seems like one thing people could do, but not the only one -- but she does feel that for mental technique-building, that it's actually something you ought to do at your own pace.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All of this to say that she's listening, trying to take in everything Keltham is trying to push at her, but with wariness, because the tools he's trying to teach her to use are tools meant for different goals than she has.&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<p>You can, of course, get the equations of Relativity just by observing the physical facts; but to really understand them, children are led to guess them in advance by contemplating certain questions and dissolving those questions as ontologically meaningless.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"How fast is the whole universe moving?\" seems unobservable from inside the universe; and, you could argue, is not only unobservable but meaningless - because in the simplest conceptual frameworks that do predict what is observable, 'motion' is the motion of particles relative to each other.&nbsp; Not, motion relative to an absolute space, that is unobservable and hence can be eliminated as an element of the theory.</p>\r\n<p>But maybe there is an absolute space?&nbsp; Maybe physics has absolute space beneath it, and everything is moving at a speed through that space.&nbsp; Maybe someday you'll discover 'laws of physics' - simplest logical rules that would reproduce a universe embedding you to observe what you observe - that imply distinguished structures that stay motionless within space, mathematical seams that are observable.&nbsp; And, measuring those, you'll discover the whole universe is moving at a billion kilometers per second relative to absolute space.&nbsp; How do you know you won't?<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Later, you're shepherded through discovering the relationship between electricity and magnetism, generalizing the classical-illusion field equations for those, and realizing that the wave propagation through that field is light.&nbsp; And this, it seems at first, implies a fixed speed for light, relative to the electrical-magnetic field.</p>\r\n<p>And you might think: couldn't you measure how fast you were moving relative to light, and so measure how fast you were moving relative to an absolute Background Space?&nbsp; So the thought experiment about the whole universe moving twice as fast - suggesting that only&nbsp;<em>relative</em> motion is real or even meaningful - has failed to predict the character of physics; there was an absolute space after all.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>But actually, every time you measure the speed of light relative to yourself, you find the same speed.&nbsp; No matter how fast you're going, or how fast the light source is moving, you find the same measured speed of light from your own perspective.</p>\r\n<p>And when you work out the logic of what that shocking fact implies, it ends up requiring that you view spatial dimensions and time dimensions as being relative to your current velocity... which is to say, the time distances and space distances that observers at different speeds observe as different quantities, are not the underlying elements of reality.</p>\r\n<p>The only thing that's still invariant from every perspective is the <em>interval</em> between two events, which in terms of classical-illusion measurements would be expressed as the square of distance in time minus the square of distance in space, with the speed of light converting units between the two.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This surprising additional math, indeed, is exactly what's required to implement a universe where there's a universal speed limit reflecting the locality of causality, and yet the only meaningful elements of reality are the positions of things relative to each other.&nbsp; That Reality went to this extra effort to make physics visibly 'relative', in this sense, is the beginning hint of a deeper truth that proves to be more general: physics is built around a certain spirit and character in which <em>relative </em>positions, not absolute positions, are the elements of reality in the ontology of physics.</p>\r\n<p>Over and over, it proves possible to start from a thought experiment like \"If I'm inside a sealed room, should I be able to tell if I'm staying still or moving at a constant velocity of a million miles per hour?\", or \"Should we be able to tell whether the whole universe is rotating or not, relative to absolute space, by seeing if there's centripetal forces being generated by the rotation?\", to answer \"No!&nbsp; If I can't see the quantity from my own perspective, ultimate physics must be arranged in a way to make that quantity not exist!\".&nbsp; One can <em>correctly</em> derive intricate laws of physics from that principle.</p>\r\n<p>It's idealistic reasoning, but it's a form of idealistic reasoning that&nbsp;<em>Reality itself seems to use,</em>&nbsp;the same way that Reality seems fond of calculus, or continuous quantities, or numbers and math more generally.&nbsp; You could say, it's first-principles idealistic reasoning, using the sort of idealistic first principles that Reality has been empirically observed to respect, and which prove to cause people to correctly guess physics without observing it first if they're led to guess using those principles.</p>\r\n<p>(Golarion physics, he strongly suspects, is partially an imitation of that simple dath ilani physics, and partially has been artificially constructed and modified and complicated away from that physics; so that this universe can run both mortal biology copied off dath ilan and dath ilan's physics, and also include magic and souls.)</p>",

The integral over the squared absolute values of those amplitudes, the measure, seems to describe <em>how real something is - </em>or rather how&nbsp;<em>relatively real</em> something is, because physics doesn't talk about the&nbsp;<em>absolute</em> amount of reality, at that lowest level.&nbsp;

There's a version of you that sees the smaller outcome every time, a thousand times, but those yous are only 1/3^1000 as real, and you'll almost never find yourself there / only experience yourself seeing that to a very tiny degree.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There's no physical difference that would be observable if you doubled all the tiny amounts-of-realness.</p>\r\n<p>And this is also the kind of physical principle that you can correctly guess from thought experiments about Relativity: what would it even <em>mean</em> if everything everywhere simultaneously became twice as real?</p>\r\n<p>You can get this quality of quantum physics by observing experiments, but you can also advance-guess its character via the vastly productive principle of Relativistic thought experiments: it's meaningless to imagine all of Existence becoming twice as real, so reality is only relative, and that's why physics over amounts-of-realness only speaks of the relative quantity of those amounts.&nbsp; Some things can be realer than other things; it is meaningless to ask how real they are in an absolute sense.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There's a meaning to one person being twice as real <em>as another</em>, inside of larger Reality.&nbsp; You're twice as likely to meet people who exist in twice as many places.</p>\r\n<p>But what does it feel like from the inside to become twice as real, or half as real, in an <em>absolute </em>sense?&nbsp; Nothing, and in fact the thought isn't meaningful, just like there are no absolute phases in quantum mechanics, only relative phases of the amplitudes.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>One future can be more real than another, and you'll mostly experience yourself in the futures that are more real; when you look back in your past, you'll find that the experimental statistics for results roughly match the physics-predicted amplitudes of those results.</p>\r\n<p>But when you look at yourself and question how real you are in an absolute sense - imagine yourself becoming twice as real, or half as real<em>&nbsp;</em>- you're imagining something that wouldn't feel like anything, because it doesn't mean anything;

the answer to the malformed question, \"Why does anything exist at all?\"&nbsp; It doesn't require anything larger than yourself to give you existence, as would then need some further outer factor to lend existence in infinite regression.&nbsp; Structures of relative realness always find themselves to be as real as themselves, however much more or less they exist compared to other things; and that's why you find yourself inside a physics ultimately comprised of a structure of relative-realness.</p>\r\n<p>In dath ilan that physics over relatively-real elements was 'quantum mechanics' over 'amplitudes'; but even if it's something else inside Pharasma's Creation, it'll ultimately be made out of stuff that embodies relative quantities of existence.&nbsp; Nothing that exists can be absolutely real (as isn't even a meaningful concept) but only relatively real to other things, so whenever you look closely enough at something that exists, you'll find out that it's made out of tiny bits of relative-degree-of-realness.</p>",

And if you prefer to exist in as large a possible a share of the universes that there are, and for the duration of your existence in every universe to be as large as possible, and for the people you care about and all people who aren't insane people who want to die to live in as many universes as possible, and you would be distressed to learn that you are murdered in your sleep half the time you fall asleep, then she's pretty sure you end up not an average utilitarian.</p>\r\n<p>She's being snarky - it's much harder not to in her thoughts - so she does want to note that she appreciates Keltham not trying to make the infinities argument to her until she was smart enough to immediately better-articulate her preference; if he'd said that to a small Carissa she might've thought she had to be persuaded because she couldn't describe what she cared about coherently, and she - appreciates it, about Keltham, that he didn't try that.</p>",

Not the only input, but human values probably have something like 90% overlap with the actual system. Most people think it&rsquo;s right and just that bad people go to Hell. Carissa doesn&rsquo;t especially agree with them, but the thing Pharasma is doing is recognizably in most of its details in the space of things humans might do, and you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily expect that from things done by a bizarre and distant alien.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Keltham has perhaps by now read about how war is practiced between nations in Golarion, though he won&rsquo;t have seen it firsthand. Armies march through farmland claimed by the enemy faction, killing everyone who resists, taking all their food and leaving those they do not kill to starve, raping women, taking slaves, slaughtering children. Ordinary people are called up to serve in those armies; ordinary people do those acts, because they can, because everyone else is doing it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s not what Chelish armies do because someone engineered Cheliax that way; that&rsquo;s what ordinary Taldane or Qadiran armies do, in the ordinary course of war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The worst half of those soldiers will go to Hell, and while Carissa thinks that Hell should make better use of them, she does think that the assessment that they are Lawful Evil is basically correct, and Axis is reasonable in not wanting to let them in, and a Hell which was merely a place full of people like them would be awful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By some estimates she dug up while she was doing research for her wall, one in ten people is a slaveowner. It&rsquo;s higher in Cheliax, of course, which wants everyone to be a slaveowner to damn them, but across history the best estimate is that it&rsquo;s one in ten. Not all of those go to Hell, but they sure do go a way towards explaining why about one in ten people go to Hell.</p>\r\n<p>(Carissa&rsquo;s family owns slaves. The staff at the villa the first few days, before Otolmens picked Broom and they realized it was a vulnerability, were all slaves, if Keltham hadn&rsquo;t figured that out. The fire elementals who heat the water are slaves. They didn&rsquo;t realize right away that they should hide from Keltham things like how people enjoy gladiatorial contests and public executions, because that&rsquo;s true in Taldor too.)</p>\r\n<p>That is, to her, the fundamental expression of who Pharasma is and what Pharasma wants: people go to an afterlife that reflects the choices they made in life, and that afterlife is good or bad depending on whether the choices they made in life were conducive to good worlds or bad ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You can disagree with that, of course, but nothing about it feels especially inhuman.

But sure, he may have been put in position to witness statistically unrepresentative amounts of damnation due to soul-sale.</p>\r\n<p>The thing is, that Pharasma permits Peranza to go to Hell after being forced to sell her soul, or that She traded away the possibility and actuality of children getting Maledicted even if She mildly dispreferred that, is strongly informative about what sort of entity Pharasma actually is.</p>\r\n<p>On a larger scale, he figured out sometime around INT 27 that part of why almost everyone in Cheliax goes to Hell is that their fiat currency is backed by souls, causing everyone's acts of spending money to count as soul-trading.&nbsp; He's not sure how large a part that is of Chelish universal-damnation protocols - they could ask Erecura or Dispater later, if safe oaths can be established there - but it's some part, given that Cheliax goes to the effort at all.</p>\r\n<p>Cheliax might be a statistically unrepresentative place for Keltham to have landed inside of Creation, receiving a disproportionate amount of effort from Asmodeus because Golarion is where Rovagug is contained or because Golarion is where prophecy is shattered.&nbsp; But that Cheliax is a <em> possible mode for planets in Pharasma's Creation </em> means that if Pharasma's Creation is allowed to continue, maybe it all goes to Cheliax.&nbsp; He does not particularly think that Asmodeus has a worse chance of reshaping Creation in His preference than nonancient Iomedae has of saving it.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>And then of course there's all the feral kids in the Boneyard - many of whom merely go to the Abyss or Abaddon, of course, but some of whom go to Hell, including the ones who choose Hell at the gates of Abaddon. <br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Those are some of the defects-from-a-humane-standpoint in <em> who </em> goes to Hell.&nbsp; There's also the point that <em> eternal, soul-destroying torment </em> is not a human standpoint on <em> deserved revenge </em> even <em> if </em> somebody did terrible things in life and even <em> if </em> you legitimate the entire emotion of revenge.</p>\r\n<p>He is aware, at this level of Intelligence, that dath ilan probably has some amount of mortal-Golarion-like horror in its hidden past.&nbsp; He genuinely does not know how much.&nbsp; He genuinely does not know the extent to which dath ilan's past was Golarion-without-magic, before dath ilan did heritage-optimization to make it better; or if the people in Golarion have interbred with Evil beings, or had some of their Goodness and Intelligence destroyed by selection pressures over millennia.</p>\r\n<p>But it - really doesn't seem to him - when he looks inside himself, for emotions buried under culture, that would have evolved in him - it doesn't seem to him, if he felt really angry at somebody, angry enough to want to hurt them even if nothing good would come of that, that he'd want to hurt them forever and ever until they turned into paving stones, forgot their names and the hurt they'd dealt to him, and then <em> go on hurting them.</em>&nbsp; Humanoids evolving from before civilization started, before farming started, shouldn't want to levy unbounded punishments on each other for bounded misdeeds, that's not where the evolutionarily stable strategy should settle.</p>\r\n<p>Hell - doesn't seem to him like a concept - that human beings would invent for themselves from scratch - if they didn't grow up in Golarion, thinking of it as part of the way-things-are.</p>\r\n<p>He's not sure.&nbsp; It's a guess that could be wrong in a same direction that he's been wrong before.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>It's not really a crux, none of this is a crux - he should warn her, before this line of thought continues for too long - because at INT 27 he lost his ability to think of Evil humans in Golarion as anything but bigger Boneyard children.&nbsp; He was <em> trying </em> to hold onto his sense of people in Golarion as having their own virtues and strengths, who were experienced emergency responders even if they couldn't pass 13-year-old adulthood tests, who had their own plans and purposes even if they were INT 10 or INT 8.&nbsp; He tried to keep hold of that sense, he really did.&nbsp; He lost his last grasp on it after he put on the artifact headband.</p>\r\n<p>That people in Golarion damn themselves is the final proof of their innocence, in a way.&nbsp; Why think that they really understand the pain they deal to others, any more than their mind can successfully span time to understand the pain they're bringing upon themselves in the future?&nbsp; The future isn't really real to them, and that's why they destroy it.</p>",

Her theory is that basically most alien species either evolved, or are copies from versions elsewhere who evolved, or were deliberately bred for intelligence by other intelligent species, and especially the ones who evolved or are copied from versions who evolved are the most useful input they have of what kinds of evolved species you might get, out there in Greater Reality.

With diamond manufacture and contraception you can just make sure babies almost never die and get called right back when they do!). She's ....deeply uncertain about whether that'd make them favor erasing the world. It doesn't seem overdetermined by being appalled about Hell, it depends on your estimate of whether it's possible to destroy just Hell (she's still confused about what presumptive-future-Keltham-capabilities let him make a trumpet heard all over the universe before painlessly destroying it, but don't let him do that same thing in just Hell - perhaps by compacting with some gods elsewhere so they know how to counteract it in their own domains?), and it depends on your estimate of what Greater Reality is like and on your estimate of how good lives in Heaven and Axis are and on a lot of other things they haven't yet gotten to.</p>\r\n<p>She'd be very surprised if, presented with that, smart humans with lots of time to think all arrived at the same answer (unless there is a clever way to destroy just Hell with success near-guaranteed; then, she supposes, they'll all agree on that.)</p>\r\n<p>Keltham keeps saying that it's overdetermined, that Golarion is so wildly far beyond the line any dath ilani would permit to exist, and Carissa's main prediction is that among Golarionites on reflection, wiser and with time to think, it's not overdetermined; they'll be all over the place. Which may not be worth testing at great expense, if it wouldn't be decisive to Keltham even if true.</p>",

When she was planning to destroy Cheliax to buy them another month of time, she considered and rejected getting anyone she loved out; if she wasn't willing to do it to them, she felt, she shouldn't be willing to do it at all. Instead of her family, maybe Keltham should just pick four random people to Wishnap to Elysium; it'd do exactly as much harm-reduction, and it wouldn't deceive the parts of their minds that can only conceive of bad things on human scales.&nbsp; Maybe none of that actually coheres, but she thinks it does, or is a pointer to something that does: she thinks that part of the 'deontology' of a world of Carissae would be that anyone in one of those who decided it was worth bombing a city did not get themselves or their loved ones to safety first.</p>",

Carissa expects/expected their continuations to be awful.&nbsp; His model of Outer Gods and Entities is that the ones which don't care about people will mainly not use matter in a way that involves it being people.</p>\r\n<p>Even the Makers of the Magical Continuum, which very likely don't care about people, aren't taking all of the matter and realityfluid in the Magical Continuum and turning it into unhappy people.&nbsp; Past-Keltham, possibly, got sent to Golarion because it was a particular kind of intervention that was cheaper to buy from the Makers than anything more sensible; he was not put someplace that would hurt him <em>as much as possible.</em></p>\r\n<p>He doesn't think that Entities with simulating-eyes on Pharasma's Creation, or who trade with the Makers of the Magical Continuum for information from it, that care about the sentients within it at all, would be trying to continue the people there past the end of Pharasma's Creation with a goal of hurting them.&nbsp; The ones who care about continuations at all, he would hope, are themselves nice; or trading with Entities that are, in the sum of their goals and auction bids, nice.&nbsp; If that's not so, he's substantially more peeved with whatever hypothetical Entities sent him here to destroy Creation, and also it seems less probable that caring Entities would want that of him in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>That <em>he </em>is sent here, who will deliver an ultimatum to Pharasma to <em>improve living conditions</em> or be destroyed, is some evidence that he wouldn't have been sent here if the expected result of destroying Creation were to isekai everyone here to worse-than-Hell.&nbsp; Though of course, the Entities that sent him here could be acting deceptive about that, expecting himself, or Pharasma, to be deceived by the apparent evidence of Their actions.</p>",

Most people who have ever lived probably have no idea if Hell is real, or if it's really very bad, or if Elysium turns them into a strange alien, or if they'd prefer either to nonexistence. (This is testable: they can go ask people in remote villages someplace). The thing Keltham is postulating, selection, where people who thought clearly about the world and realized they didn't want to live in it had fewer offspring, could only possibly have happened among a tiny segment of the population which had any confident knowledge about the afterlives (high-level spellcasters and people who get trustworthy information from them) and the ability to based on that control whether they had children, which most people can only do through lifelong celibacy.</p>\r\n<p>(She does suspect that humans are selected against finding lifelong celibacy easy.)</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, coherent reasoning is useful for tons of other things that affect whether your children live to adulthood: planning which crops to plant, how much seed corn to hold in reserve, how to interpret signs of a coming storm, how to decide when to flee and when to stand and fight. There is extremely strong selection in favor of coherent reasoning; her best guess as to why everyone isn't ridiculously good at it is that there are some deep physical tradeoffs.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless, she doesn't think this matters. The process by which people arrived at their current reasoning abilities and attitudes about the afterlives aren't relevant to her. The reasoning abilities are relevant and the attitudes, but not the process.</p>\r\n<p>And she doesn't care if they 'emotionally believe' anything Keltham has to say. If they, in fact, told about Greater Reality and about the existing afterlives, want to go to the existing afterlives, then even if this is not what Keltham thinks they should want, or not what he thinks a different person with different abilities would want, it doesn't matter, because they are not Keltham's slave to dispose of as suits him; they should get the thing they actually want, not the thing that Keltham believes they would want if they were bred for or otherwise predisposed to greater coherence.</p>\r\n<p>It really and truly feels to Carissa like it is profound Evil Keltham is describing here, to destroy someone's soul over your own conviction that, while they prefer Heaven to the distribution of outcomes in Greater Reality you described to them (or reject the premise that experiential-thread is what matters), if they were better at reasoning they'd most likely want something else. She just doesn't think it's all right to do that to people, ever; she thinks you'd kind of have to lack some essential human sensibility that dath ilan perhaps bred out of its <em>own </em>population in order to <em>want </em>to.</p>",

Or, insofar as they do care about you, is actively steering you against where you'd want to go if fully informed, i.e., trying to steer you into Lawful Evil.</p>\r\n<p>Someone who grew up that way, might come out of that with a different moral outlook on parentalism, than someone who grew up in dath ilan.</p>\r\n<p>Civilization's prediction markets are basically well-calibrated; Governance has a functioning delegacy that puts nonassholes in charge and could immediately kick out any who turned asshole later.&nbsp; Dath ilan is nonetheless very conservative about applying parentalism, because it's understood that parentalism incurs long-term costs for short-term gains.&nbsp; When you prevent people from making their own mistakes, you also prevent people from learning from them... well, of course that's also more of a long-term benefit <em>in </em>dath ilan, where people and societies actually do learn from mistakes.</p>\r\n<p>But if you don't guard the heavy machinery well enough, a kid can wander in and get killed, and then they can't learn from that.&nbsp; Or rather, the lesson comes in the Future, but that's a little late.</p>\r\n<p>Dath ilan has always staged its degree of parentalism - as measured by the difficulty of the competence tests you need to pass before doing something supposedly harmful - with the goal of giving the smaller minds (like kids) the chance to make their own mistakes; <em>provided </em>that those mistakes aren't going to cause severe irrevocable damage.&nbsp; That is, Civilization is heavily but not massively conservative in the direction of more letting people make their own mistakes.&nbsp; Adults with learning disabilities who'll never be able to pass the relevant competence test get stronger guardrails set around them, because they <em>can't </em>learn from their mistakes, and so there's not as much long-term benefit to letting them hurt themselves.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that people in Golarion have probably been implicitly selected to instinctively distrust, hate, and resent authorities, in a world where authorities weren't in fact looking out for their best interests... well, mostly it strikes him as possibly reflecting a trope about unreasonably-difficult+thoughtexperiments:&nbsp; what if an organism couldn't steer to avoid hurting themselves, couldn't think about the question intelligently, couldn't learn from experience either because the problem was oneshot-else-die or because they were too dumb to generalize the right lessons, <em>and </em>they'd been evolutionarily selected to disbelieve in the possibility of anyone else helping them steer, <em>and </em>to feel angry and awful if you tried to help them anyways?</p>\r\n<p>And there's an old fallback in overly-difficult thoughtexperiments like that one:&nbsp; Go back to what's actually true.&nbsp; People can tie themselves up in tangled knots of belief and trust and resentment of parentalism, but afterlives are just real, cryonics is just real, the Future is just a place and so is Greater Reality.&nbsp; The core idea cutting through all dath ilan's arrangements is this: that when the test shows that you <em>see reality clearly,</em> you are said to be ready to navigate it yourself, even if society doesn't like your choices.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The reason why kids are prevented from killing themselves generally, and truekilling themselves especially, before they pass the respective competence tests to choose either, is not that Civilization thinks it proper for parents to have different interests in children than children have in themselves.&nbsp; It is that Civilization is reasonably certain that it does in fact know something that the kids don't know, and to be more meta-rational than the kids about which of them is more likely to know it: namely, the value-of-information from staying alive longer to see what unfolds.&nbsp; When prediction markets become sufficiently certain that somebody would say years later that they should've been allowed to suicide years earlier, that's an automatic license to do so no matter how young you are at the time.</p>\r\n<p>He's sympathetic to the idea that INT 10 people in Golarion should be allowed to hurt themselves, maybe deal themselves lifelong crippling injuries that they can't afford to get healed, if they say to the likes of gods and INT 29 mortals:&nbsp; \"Stay out of my business.\"&nbsp; Past-Keltham fell on the Individualistic side of Civilization's moral balances; he wanted Civilization to move more in the direction of people looking out for themselves, rather than looking out for others.</p>\r\n<p>You could make a strong case for letting eight-year-olds get themselves killed that way, once they're old enough not to make the wrong choices in the Boneyard; in the long run that provides the benefit of calibrating future generations to accept the right amount of advice.&nbsp; Conversely, if you prevent kids from killing themselves or force them to take advice, standard dysgenic mutational pressures may produce increasingly suicidal or intransigent kids.</p>\r\n<p>But he starts to worry when it comes to the question of letting people go to Hell; or for that matter, having children in Cheliax if Cheliax stays the way it is.&nbsp; At that point it starts to become proper for the Government to step in and do something about it, at least if it's dath ilani Governance rather than Golarion royalty.&nbsp; That's a kind of mistake that smaller agents really <em>can't </em>recover from, and it's the proper job of larger agencies to guard them parentally until the smaller agents pass the relevant competence tests for having understood what they're getting into.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Past-Keltham thought in dath ilan that people ought to be more selfish, and wished that Civilization were set up to work with more selfish people.&nbsp; But even he considered there to be an obvious caveat for having systems in place such that children could successfully grow up, and not just, like, get eaten by the first adult who talked them into signing a legal release allowing them to be eaten.</p>",

That seems entirely fair to her. She doesn't think that \"I'll help seal Rovagug, if you do X once Rovagug is sealed\" is at all the same kind of conduct as \"I'll destroy the world, if you don't do X which makes me not want to\" -- a Carissa, obviously, would have helped seal Rovagug without conditions, but she's happy to work with entities of the first type and fundamentally thinks the second ought to be preemptively cryopreserved for everyone else's protection. And while if someone ELSE went and released Rovagug this week she would be willing to make concessions to get Keltham to help her fight him, they'd be concessions to Keltham's wants, not to mortals' wants, and it's another thing entirely to say that he should himself get the rewards of having fought Rovagug if he didn't.</p>\r\n<p>Carissa thinks that mortals have more of a seat at the table in Sarenrae's values, or Shelyn's, or Desna's, or Shizuru's, than in Keltham's; she thinks that those gods have something closer to the median values of a mortal in Golarion than Keltham does. She thinks that dath ilani morality is - askew in important respects from human values which make Keltham a particularly bad representative of humanity.</p>\r\n<p>Dath ilani mostly are easy to get to no longer want to live. Golarionites aren't. Dath ilani mostly experience cognitive enhancement as personality death. Golarionites don't. Dath ilani mostly think about morality in precise theoretical terms borrowed from bargaining - fair shares, what mortals would have had if they'd helped seal Rovagug - and Golarionites don't. dath ilani don't seem to have the same care for tradition and history that Golarionites have. None of the things Keltham is saying are Golarionite things. He does not represent Golarionite values, and his having power would not make the world more of one in which Golarionite values, especially the extremely common Golarionite value of not being annihilated, would be represented.</p>\r\n<p>Keltham is another alien entity who wants to destroy the world if it doesn't meet with his approval, and he is not an alien entity whose wants actually serve the people whose lives he is toying with.&nbsp;</p>",

Then all the species where such resentments were common would have dwindled and died out.</p>\r\n<p>...it occurs to her, thinking about it from this angle, that elves famously have few children. She had always heard it attributed to this planet not being as suitable for childbearing as their original planet, but it does seem to function as evidence that species might just by collective decision wipe themselves out. (This hasn't occurred with elves because they are immortal, so even though their rare births don't replace the rate of their rare deaths they die out only slowly, as she was told it.)</p>\r\n<p>She does think that humans obviously should be permitted to be born on Golarion. If there is one species where she can say this with confidence, it is humans, because she does not really know what it is like to be a nonhuman born on Golarion and she does know that to be a human is to have something precious and glorious and good that she would trade infinite suffering to have experienced even briefly.</p>\r\n<p>She also thinks that 'children that gods will keep as cattle or pets and never permit a true Civilization' is - obviously irrelevant, on Keltham's assumption that eventually everyone ends up in Greater Reality? Everyone will, if he's right about that, spend subjective eternity in a true Civilization, and the only question is whether it's a horrendous wrong that some of them will spend a while first in Golarion and its afterlives. 'they never get Civilization' is if Keltham's right not at all a possibility on the table. The only possibility is that they get something else first.</p>\r\n<p>And if Keltham is wrong and what waits for those annihilated here is not some glorious Civilization, well, that seems like a wholly sufficient argument against annihilating this place, once you've dealt with Hell.</p>",

This is of course not a very strong claim, in Golarion terms; overwhelmingly, a person who has power over you is not a person it is safe to make requests of, or safe to contradict, or safe to show how you work; when you expose your internals to someone, or tell them what you need, you are giving them more ways to hurt you. She did try, sometimes, but it didn't work, and - yes, that interaction in the hallway was important, in shaping all of Carissa's strategies for surviving in Keltham's fortress.</p>\r\n<p>It is a natural sort of thing to do, when you are a prisoner or a slave or otherwise in a precarious situation, to test the smallest possible disobedience, something for which the punishment will almost certainly be survivable (and if it's not, well, you weren't going to survive anyway, in that case). Then you learn how quickly your captors are moved to anger, what warning signs you can see in them, how badly they hurt you, what finally satisfies them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So Keltham said, \"Carissa, with me\", and he had just told her that she no longer belonged to him, and so she didn't obey.

Not for not <em>understanding</em>, but for not <em>acting;</em> it would be reasonable and just, to hate her for that, if she had the power to do something about it.</p>\r\n<p>And it is likewise an error, she thinks, to hate Asmodeus for having Asmodeus's utility-function; but to hate him for all the torture - yes, that is correct. Hating him for all the torture is entirely reasonable. If he hadn't done it yet but was trying his best it'd be reasonable to hate him for that too. Carissa is pretty sure she hates Asmodeus, though she doesn't spend a lot of time on hating Asmodeus because she is pretty busy trying to kill him.</p>",

She does not think that you can hate people only if <em>you </em>are powerless, just only based on their actual capacities. He asked her if he was supposed to hate her for not caring enough about the paving stones in Hell, and the answer to that, in the framework she thinks her world might use, is no. If he'd asked if he was supposed to hate her for trying to stop him, for being someone who might stop him, then she would have said yes, and given him the symmetry that seems so important to him in believing her that her instincts and principles are not just about hurting him.&nbsp; If he hates her for the fact she would help Broom stop him if she could (if this did not qualify as a betrayal of her word, which she means to keep),&nbsp; then yes, that would be just. Hate based on a true model of her, based on something she really in fact might attempt, and based on what she is trying to do and not whether she cares about things deep in her own heart.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It does seem important to her, that a person in the dungeons of Egorian, hating Abrogail Thrune and wishing her dead, is not the same as Abrogail Thrune hating that person and enjoying herself as she plans their destruction. Carissa does, actually, think that a society of Carissae would embrace the dungeon-person's hatred as an emotion it is not better to erase or suppress, except pragmatically; an emotion that is correct like grief is sometimes correct or like anger is sometimes correct. And she thinks a society of Carissae would judge Abrogail Thrune, for hating the prisoner back, as it would be a hatred out of proportion to the prisoner's actual ability to cause harm.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With that said, there is something to that diagnosis of her, that she is quick to believe herself powerless, that in Cheliax an apparent opportunity to hurt someone powerful would be a&nbsp;<em>test,&nbsp;</em>that they tried very hard to make it the case that apparent power was still powerlessness, that seeing hope was no reason to believe there was hope.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She .....isn't actually concerned at all about a reward for thinking yourself powerless. Being powerless is worse than most kinds of torture. The half-minute in the hallway while Keltham threatened to statue her is more memorable and more vivid and more terrifying and awful than any punishment she's ever undergone save the other time someone threatened to statue her.&nbsp; There's no way any person with a functioning brain would like being powerless.</p>\r\n<p>But a person can be trained to have a very strong assumption that they are powerless even if they see what appears to be an opportunity to change something. And it is actually still difficult to imagine, to Carissa that Keltham would have reasonably believed himself in danger from her in his own fortress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(He didn't have security trailing them? He didn't have items with Spell Resistance she had no hope of defeating, and contingent spells set to whisk him to safety if anything happened? He hadn't had someone with Spell Gauge confirm she had no remaining spells prepared and not expended???)</p>",

Now that she understands him better she is trying to be more careful to distinguish details when she thinks them, to note that he said he would statue her <em>at least</em> until he was Wished up and only <em>possibly</em> until something happened that she considered quite unlikely to happen before the end. And she imagines he evaluated it unlikely he would get killed in the City of Brass and that she would never be unstatued.</p>\r\n<p>But mid-Carissa was not making that distinction, and did not place much weight on the 'at least', and parsed the situation as very probably one from which she would never wake before her ultimate destruction.</p>\r\n<p>She thinks that, if you are talking to Golarion people over whom you have absolute power, you do need, indeed, either great skill or great caution, to not terrorize them out of their minds when you explain how your best alternative to their cooperation is to turn them into a statue potentially until you've obtained an artifact headband. Golarion people do not, in fact, parse that as not a threat, but as a threat framed bizarrely; they do not automatically believe you about your claims about what's in your own interests absent their cooperation, and assume you will exaggerate or lie about or muddle those to get the concessions you want, and so they have only the action to evaluate, obviously threat-like in nature. She thinks that mostly Golarion people with absolute power handle this by just giving orders, in cases where their words are backed by implicit-willingness-to-turn-to-stone, and saving negotiations for cases where their words are not backed by implicit-willingness-to-turn-to-stone.</p>\r\n<p>Abrogail made her no longer afraid <em>she would statue Carissa for disobedient thoughts, </em>and therefore no longer interrupted by constant terror whenever she had a thought that she imagined might provoke the queen.

She doesn't love dath ilan and it doesn't love her and she actually does not care at all about, would not take any comfort in, whatever dath ilan has to say, about what happened. If Keltham is gone, as he sometimes says he is, then there isn't anything anyone can say that would help and not hurt, but offering her what dath ilan has to say is some kind of cruel parody of the thing that she wanted. It wasn't a promise to dath ilan.</p>",

And it felt like, when she tried desperately to tell him what he could do to not hurt her, he listened, and then categorically refused to do it, and that was suggestive, about how well it would go if she kept desperately trying.</p>",

It is helpful to replace the abstract belief someone else is trying hard with specific examples of times and ways they tried hard and their communications weren't met with any signal they could usefully interpret, and in the case where actually one of them isn't trying very hard, it'd be helpful for that to come to light too. It seems like Keltham thinks that finding-examples is some kind of bad game to play, and she understands that often when he has objections like that he has good reasons behind them, but that is absolutely something Carissa is doing deliberately and what she thought the point of this conversation was - to help them both arrive at, hopefully, the more grounded belief that the other person has been trying very hard.</p>\r\n<p>Also, once they have some examples of where exactly they misunderstand each other, they can change their behavior in similar situations in the future. Like, if Carissa is ever again tempted to say \"if you do X less it'll make it easier for me to not get mad\", she will add, \"if you are going to act on this advice I would appreciate you saying that you intend to do so\".</p>\r\n<p>And she definitely won't when mildly annoyed with Keltham do anything that might be possible to misinterpret as Withdrawing From Friendship And Cooperation.</p>\r\n<p>And if she finds herself getting tired of dath ilani communication norms, instead of \"I have my own ideas about how people could communicate healthily, but I sure didn't get them from Cheliax and I don't know if they'll work\", she will say \"hey let's sit down and negotiate a mutually agreeable comms protocol\".</p>",

The shape that it made her is not the shape she would have grown on her own, outside Cheliax, but there's not a lot to be gained, even here and now where she has the wisdom and distance and insight to do it, in trying to be the person she would have been if she hadn't grown up in Cheliax; that person is that person, and Carissa is Carissa.</p>\r\n<p>And there was a Conspiracy, when she offered herself to Keltham, and it is entirely reasonable and fair of him to not want to count that, to not want to hold her to anything she said then, but - but as he said to her at one point, if you take away culpability and responsibility in everything Carissa did in Cheliax, there's nothing left, really. She did not, when she made those promises, think that they were pretend because they were inside of the Conspiracy.</p>\r\n<p>It was in part because she still loved Keltham, because she still wanted to be his, that she came to him, instead of doing something that from the outside would be more likely to achieve her goals, like accepting from Osirion a ludicrous amount of money for a warning about what Keltham was planning and then warning every other god as well.</p>\r\n<p>And it is - very <em>Keltham</em>, of mid-Keltham, who denied he was Keltham at all, to not want to have something that he was going to get wrong, something that was dishonest, and probably it would have damaged him, to try to disentangle what inside Carissa was real, what kinds of realness was acceptable to him. Certainly she expects it would have hurt him, if he'd tried to carry on from where they'd once been. ...maybe it would also have hurt her. She's not as sure. She thinks that Keltham mostly hurts her when they're <em>not </em>clear on who wins, so he thinks he has to fight, and not when he is clear on it.</p>\r\n<p>In her imagination, if she is unconstrained by real Keltham and where he was at and what he needed, and just imagining the thing that would have been good for Carissa-who-loved-Keltham, when she arrived, Keltham would have told her his plan, up front, crying, told her he did not want to do it, that he hoped she could find another way, but that he had to, for all the people in Hell, if he couldn't find another way, and asked her if she still loved him, if she would ever have loved him if she had known that about him from the start, and she would have cried, and said that if there were an answer to that question which involved the world not ending she'd give it regardless of which one it was, but if there really isn't, if he really and truly cannot be moved on that and is eager to be moved on everything else - then yes, she still loves him. And the things she told him were good, were good; she never lied to him about that. And if he hurt her now, that would be good.</p>\r\n<p>But objectively it was probably wildly more sensible for him to break up with her.</p>",
