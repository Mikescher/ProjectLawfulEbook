Paladins can't experience fear, but they can experience eternal torture, and Cheliax delights in sending them on to it; there are places where more good can be done at a lower cost. But in the end, Cheliax is going to need to be overthrown, and you have to be in Cheliax to see the fractures when they start and can be encouraged in spreading. Plus, sometimes something really unexpected happens and you need to have people who can act quickly.&nbsp;<br /><br />Andreu Bassols (not his birth name) has been living in Egorian for two years, having moved from a small farming village when his parents died and it didn't seem worth keeping up the farm alone. He loads and unloads river barges; he's a strong man, built for hard labor. He has, beneath the skin on his neck and separately beneath the skin on his thigh, two minor magic items, which conceal an aura that would otherwise radiate from him and betray him. Either would be sufficient, but it's a new experimental type of magic item, and either could fail, so it's better to have both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He reads as having seven intelligence; his thoughts, when read, are slow, and uninteresting. This is the greatest sacrifice, aside from the possible eternity of damnation; the effect could not be manufactured. It had to be induced for real. He can lift it, when he puts his healing to that purpose, but it's risky, so he does it rarely.&nbsp;<br /><br />He did it this morning; knelt in the cellar he sleeps in, the walls and ceiling too thick for Detect Thoughts, and healed himself, and read an encoded report delivered on a river barge, and broke down the plan into steps he would still, later, understand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's afternoon, now, and he is pushing a wheelbarrow of potatoes into the kitchens of the palace in Egorian.&nbsp;</p>",

It's objectively not suspicious, in new Cheliax, but would he have found it so? Maybe; it's hard to be suspicious only of the exactly correct things. And if Keltham is going to be suspicious of everything then maybe it's not enough to do things you'd do in new Cheliax, maybe you'd have to only do things that'd parse to him as having absolutely no suspicious traits - except then&nbsp;<em>that's&nbsp;</em>obviously manipulated -</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To Maillol, Carissa appears to be staring off into the middle distance frowning for a long time after the Grand High Priestess departs.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

We get into a mess if we try to lie about how the entire death and sorting system works, so Asmodia should tell the truth that she sold her soul - but voluntarily, on her graduation and before joining the project, because she's really good at math and wanted to secure an academic role in Hell if she got herself gobbled up right away at the Worldwound.

We lose if he ever learns something he isn&rsquo;t ready to accept. High Priestess Subirachs is here to try to make you valuable enough that Keltham will change his own rules to have you; I&rsquo;m here to try to keep you from saying things that separate Cheliax from Taldor.</p>\r\n<p>A question you might be considering: what, then, is the role of our lessons? The answer is that only an Evil dath ilani is competent to lie to a Good dath ilani, and so we will have to become them, and that Keltham isn&rsquo;t going to want girls who can&rsquo;t keep up with him, so the girls valuable to the project are the ones who can. All of us would have been taken off this project by now, if learning how to think wasn&rsquo;t totally essential to it, or if it was possible to learn how to think like a dath ilani with anything less than a full time effort. A dath ilani is very nearly priceless to Cheliax. You have the chance to become one. You should be utterly ruthless about arranging to succeed at your lessons; if you think of something that might help, request it. If you think of something that&rsquo;s getting in the way, we will check if we can be rid of it.</p>\r\n<p>The punishment order I laid out earlier is obviously heretical. It probably won&rsquo;t work. It has been authorized anyway because it is that important for all of you to master this art: a thousand important things might be set aside, if that makes you faster at learning to think.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m going to do the draw now, for who gets punished normally, so the effects of punishment don&rsquo;t get mixed up with the effects of believing your superiors are out to get you, or anything like that. Mind, even if you&rsquo;re selected, you aren&rsquo;t being unduly punished, you just aren&rsquo;t being experimentally neglected. Here are slips of paper with all your names.\"<br /><br />She demonstrates them, mixes them.</p>",

And I thought to myself, you know, I can't actually think of a principled reason you can't bridge that with a scaffold and use spellsilver that far away, except for how it'd be ridiculously hard and might mess up the spellsilver and there's usually literally no reason. So I did, and started transforming my armillary amulet -\" she taps it \"- into a weapon I could use to break out, except it would've taken way too long, the weapon I wanted is a three day enchanting project, but I thought of some ways to do it faster, and Abrogail let me at this for a while because it was funny and then went back to what she'd been meaning to do with me.

We think Pilar went to Elysium as a consequence of it, somehow. As I think was reported to you, she spent yesterday at the palace with people trying to get to the bottom of what's going on, but we are still a ways away from a satisfactory answer, though the snacks have been very conclusively demonstrated nonmagical, safe, and tasty.</p>\r\n<p>Nidal's attack on you was almost certainly a divine intervention. Ione's warning was a divine intervention. A second divine intervention by Asmodeus directed us to restart the project here.

It's really obvious why she didn't do this - it's because, as literally every authority she has talked to in the last twenty-four hours told her, she's not in fact fully recovered, not tracking everything - but it was still her job.

It worked out fine, but it might not have. It's possible your curse is trying to get you in the habit of doing curse things without checking if they are also the best deal you can get Cheliax and our Lord. It is stupid, dangerous, and stupidly dangerous to operate in the palace without understanding the Queen and what she'll want to hear about and what to involve her in directly, but I am tempering my judgment over that because I'm not sure that the important people in the room would've known what to tell you.</p>\r\n<p>It is very Asmodean to be able to make yourself believe useful things that you know on some level Nemamel, with your information, wouldn't believe. I don't - get why, actually, and I think it might be close to the secret of Evil dath ilan, and this might veer close towards instruction on faith, which I can't offer you, but I'm not going to punish believing that the paladins should get to go home because that'd be nice for them; your beliefs ought to serve Asmodeus, and that one did.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On the whole I don't hear major errors, in that. You are in the power of a really annoying enemy, which permits you very little of what it'd be healthy for you to enjoy; but getting rid of all Lastwall's spies is a huge achievement, and might let us root out their revolutionaries, too, if they have worse information. The myth of the Project Lawful girls exceeds our real capacities, but not for very long, maybe, if we keep learning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You may try on my headband, and think for a minute about whether there's anything else you got wrong that Pilar who was smarter would've gotten right.\"</p>",

And Hell has pretty good infrastructure for moving people from Avernus on, but still, you're going to be sort of cut off from comms for a while, potentially weeks. Potentially you get held up in the Boneyard because Pharasma doesn't like to hold trials for people who are obviously going to be resurrected. And while you're in that situation, if you get a raise, you take it, and you have no way of knowing for sure if it's Cheliax sending it. You can tell the alignment of the person offering to raise you, but..Zon-Kuthon's followers are also Lawful Evil. If you're in a known location in Hell, you're safe, your secrets are safe, Cheliax can call ahead and confirm the Raise being offered is ours...\"</p>",

When you die, you go to that devil, and they're responsible for orienting you, housing you, clothing you, training you, all of that, at which point you work in their organization until you've paid off the services provided.

My plan was always to be a weapons enchanter in Dis. It'll take me a long time to get oriented - magic works differently there, I won't be able to pick up where I left off when alive.

And then claim that it worked but the option makes it much less valuable so she doesn't get the perks, to explain the lack of Permanent Arcane Sight.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Unless to the High Priestess's awareness this is a stupid plan, in which case she can just tell them that options like that don't exist to her knowledge.</p>",

But on this Asmodeus has specific instructions, that she is to serve Him well and come to Him in Hell without thought of other choices and be treasured, and okay maybe she's not living up to that instruction just yet since she clearly had that thought process but she thinks she's being told that it is Asmodean, in this case, to serve without thought for her own interests.

She's aware that this is ridiculous, and ungrateful, and in a sense as objectively wrong as a thought can possibly be. But having feelings? Really inconvenient! Kind of the worst! It doesn't make her feel more whole and more able to handle the task ahead, it makes her feel overfull. Bloated. Lost. Stupid. Pathetic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It feels - maybe wrongly - like this whole deception is hanging on Carissa alone. Keltham's dark fantasy is that this is one of a thousand projects, half-neglected, just-in-case, but it's the real thing, the only thing they've got. She is not a participant in a system whose victory is inevitable. If they succeed it'll be because of her and if they fail it'll be because of her.</p>\r\n<p>(Asmodeus's larger victory is inevitable, though, presumably.)</p>\r\n<p>(But how much of a victory would that even be, if it occurred without fixing how Cheliax trains people and how Hell trains devils, if it held the state of the art still in its current place rather than leveraging it to make everything better..... heretical, almost definitely heretical.)</p>\r\n<p>She is at the point where she'd generally start wishing she was on fire but she's not actually quite wishing that. She doesn't feel quite ready.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A bunch of thoughts are floating around in her head half-formed, and she needs to get better at thinking them, at not ignoring them, but in Keltham's arms it's like it's hard to access the Carissa who demanded three Wishes of a devil. She halfheartedly tries to pin them all down for contemplation later, but even that feels like swimming uphill. Are tropes real? They seem to be making good predictions about Carissa not selling her soul and having some bizarre reason not to tell Keltham. Put a pin in that. Does she know anything that can justify her value to Dis? Not yet, but in a couple months, maybe. Put a pin in that. Is Hell good at what it does? Put a pin in that. What is Cayden Cailean doing. Put a pin in that. Is there a way to prove to Keltham that masochists exist and aren't all faking. Put a pin in that. Is Meritxell a good next partner for Keltham. Pin. Are they succeeding at making Keltham Asmodean or just technically-Evil, and does the latter serve them at all? Pin. The aim of all this is to make Keltham and Cheliax enough alike that when they truly meet, Keltham isn't repelled. Is the way to achieve that changing Keltham or changing Cheliax? Pin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's too much; one of those questions might well be the key to the whole thing, but she doesn't know which one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>After Keltham has fallen asleep she finds herself lying awake, terrified, arguing in her head with not-real-Keltham whose deepest underlying terror is apparently that she doesn't want to be there with him. It's not a problem she's ever had before. She's not the kind of person who lies awake imagining burning in Hell; probably burning in Hell won't be very fun, but what in the world would she gain by imagining it?&nbsp;</p>",

      "content": "<p>Carissa Sevar first came to Irori's attention when she was learning from the anomaly of Otolmens's concern, who is Abadar's cleric also much to Otolmens's concern, and it seemed that Abadar's cleric was speaking of matters that had again concerned Otolmens.&nbsp; Irori looked within Abadar's cleric at Otolmens's request and found that Abadar's cleric intended no destruction in that moment, but only to speak upon his own Way to others.</p>\r\n<p>It became visible to Irori then, upon a second look about, that Carissa Sevar had set a first foot along her Way, an unusually determined and promising Way for all that it is barely begun; Carissa Sevar has learned from the anomaly something of what it means to be a god, which is not simply about touching a Starstone or gaining power over the world or encyclopedic knowledge or some vague concept of 'perfection'.</p>\r\n<p>Irori then bargained with Asmodeus that Carissa Sevar's soul not be bought by Him, and that she not be prevented in leaving Cheliax if her footsteps took her beyond it in time.&nbsp; Asmodeus may have taken this as a challenge and decided to interpret it as a contest for Carissa Sevar's soul, which, if so, Irori had thought would probably be good for her pathway to epicness and godhood and hopefully beyond.</p>\r\n<p>By some strange course of events this led to Carissa Sevar's eternity standing in peril, at the hands of some powerful creature of Cheliax apparently meaning to transform her into a statue, ward her petrified form, bury her never to be found.&nbsp; And so Irori marked her, softly enough that neither she nor her tormentor would notice it, so that someday some caster willing to be quested by Him could retrieve her.</p>\r\n<p>A few hours later Irori got an incredibly irate call from Otolmens asking why one of the mortals in Her interdicted zone standing quite close to the anomaly seemed to now be an unfinished cleric of Irori's.&nbsp; Irori went very completely legible about how much He had absolutely not been planning to causally impact the interdicted zone in any way.&nbsp; Otolmens is still upset about this and, frankly, Irori can't blame Her.&nbsp; Otolmens has gone to nearly the greatest possible lengths available to Her to reduce the amount of divine interference around the anomaly, and the clerics and oracles around him are still accumulating.</p>\r\n<p>Irori still has no idea what the heck happened with Carissa Sevar apparently being set to be petrified and buried by some being of great power and Evil, and then her apparently being fine a few hours later.&nbsp; Even if it had somehow been a false threat, Carissa Sevar's soul does not appear scarred in the way that mortals would usually be scarred by such extreme threat and fear; it was as if the whole event had happened to someone else who was also Carissa Sevar, and so also marked by Him as His cleric.&nbsp; Memory erasure of the episode?&nbsp; Maybe she has two personalities and only one of them is scarred now, and she's currently using the other one, and that one doesn't remember?&nbsp; Irori does not have compelling theories here; nothing He has seen previously happen to observed mortals matches this.&nbsp; It is like the end of one time's thread was sliced out and spliced with the start of another; one where her soul's health is if anything improved.</p>\r\n<p>He does not know why Abadar's cleric would pay thus for an option on Carissa Sevar's soul, except for the obvious fear that it stands somehow in danger of being bought, despite Irori having bargained with Asmodeus for that not to happen.&nbsp; There are standard clauses in the compact for which Irori paid Asmodeus whereby Irori Himself could revoke it, but this He cannot be threatened into doing, nor would He do it even at Carissa Sevar's own request if she were being forced into making it.&nbsp; Irori would of course revoke it if Carissa Sevar prayed to Him and seemed in full sincerity to believe that her Way made that her next step forward, but then in a case like that there is also no reason why Abadar's cleric would need to protect her.&nbsp; Irori's best guess is that Carissa Sevar falsely believes that there is a prospect of her soul's sale being forced, and Abadar's cleric is seeking to protect her from that.&nbsp; Even the Asmodeans may not yet know her soul is unbuyable.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>With all that said, Irori does not exactly have a merchant group of which Carissa Sevar is an employee, that is monitoring Carissa Sevar and has notes to compare on her.&nbsp; Nor, in fact, is it particularly evident that Carissa Sevar would need or want any more of Irori's aid, considering how past attempts at that have been working out for Him and her.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>That also said, Irori is aware of Abadar's communications difficulties.&nbsp; Irori can perhaps send forth some mortal willing to receive a vision from Him, to speak to those mortals that Abadar trades with, and say what Irori knows and can make clear.&nbsp; But this Irori would not do of His own accord, nor does He much expect that His interests will benefit from the quested mortal hearing whatever they may hear in return.&nbsp; It would come out of Abadar's own intervention budget.</p>\r\n<p>(Which is, for those gods present in the beginning, who are not now too much in disaccord with the way that things are, more generous than any intervention budget ever granted by them to any god that was once human.)</p>",

He didn't exist, to the eyes of Golarion's gods, a week ago. Abadar, immediately on noticing him, paid Asmodeus not to engage in any of the misconduct to which Asmodeus and his followers tend, and the Asmodeans took Keltham to a secret facility for a secret project they are calling Project Lawful. For some reason the primary participants in it are Carissa Sevar, a former third-circle weapons enchanter at the Worldwound who may be the first person to have run across Keltham, and nine girls from the graduating class at Ostenso's academy of magic, who by now are rumored in Cheliax to have spectacular powers, and indeed seem to.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Pause for questions.</p>",

It's not about Good or Evil; the paladins have basically the same thing. Maybe in dath ilan you teach everyone enough Law, explicitly, that they have that expectation of common doing-the-job without having gone through a really long hard time of doing-the-job, but we don't, so that's how we build it.</p>\r\n<p>And obviously in some situations you want your soldiers to exercise initiative and argue with their orders and point out problems they observe, but - 'that sounds hard' isn't generally a situation where you do? As long as you're sourcing your girls from ones who're cleared to take the Worldwound oath - and I think you probably should be sourcing from that, it's the only bar we've got for - for being at all ready to start on this path - then you're sourcing from people in training to spend the next decade of their lives in a brutal fight in the fucking tundra against an infinite horde of demons, and no, they're not going to complain that they've got more tasks assigned than hours in the day. ....I have no idea what Ione's life plans are but I have a weird suspicion that while she's cleared for the Worldwound she actually just wants to do Nethys things which involve no boot camp at all. ...that's what it's called, boot camp, I don't know how that'd translate.\"</p>",

It proposes measuring this a couple of different ways and using the middle measurement, and referring disputes to Hell for arbitration. It can be paid out in Cheliax's fiat currency, backed by Hell, or in gold if they have enough gold. It predicts that Cheliax would learn all these things a year later, if Keltham did this work elsewhere, and does not want Cheliax worse off for being the place where Keltham did it, so the fair division (in the contract's reckoning) decreases substantially over time.</p>",

Only those sleeping in the cold would have witnessed it; perhaps not even they.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;Your strength in the Way is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. &nbsp;If you're equally good at explaining any outcome you can see, that's the same as not knowing anything.</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;Surprising claims require surprising evidence; unsurprising evidence suffices for unsurprising claims.</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;No empirical theory can prove itself except by risking its disproof.</p>\r\n<p>4. &nbsp;To convince me of your theory, make a correct prediction that no other theory makes.</p>\r\n<p>5. &nbsp;A precise true prediction is much more convincing than an imprecise true one.</p>\r\n<p>6. &nbsp;It is impossible to coherently expect to convince yourself of anything.</p>\r\n<p>7. &nbsp;You can't expect anyone else to convince you of something either, even if you think they're controlling everything you see.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><br />Asmodia has decided to wager on the prospect of solving all Keltham's seven problems within an hour, and then turning her attention to games of deception for the remaining forty-five minutes; because his #7 <em>is the key, it has to be</em>.</p>\r\n<p>It might not have been a decision she'd have made before for any Wisdom, but the added Splendour is helping, even that is helping, for some element of that is lending Asmodia a driving will and force that she had only known before in the grips of exultation.&nbsp; Keltham thinks this problem set is <em>possible</em> to at least one of his students, and maybe he would've been wrong about that; but if Keltham can <em>imagine </em>that being possible, then this Asmodia could should <em>will</em> get it done within a single hour.</p>\r\n<p>She hit his #1 and bounced, it is too poetic she does not know what it&nbsp;<em>means</em> so back off and try #2 that's just too obvious it says that the thing-that-is-a-likelihood-ratio has to be extreme to overcome an extreme thing-that-is-the-prior-odds, is there something she's missing, just assume not for now and continue, she tries #3 it doesn't solve <em>immediately</em> there's no <em>obvious</em> thing it means, so try #4 and see if solving all the fast problems helps and #4 isn't instantly obvious but Asmodia can feel in her mind the hint of a shape where it might be pointing so she starts scribbling down numbers.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Cheliax has fewer proverbs about mathematics than does dath ilan; it lacks in particular a proverb to the effect that quite often in mathematics, and with only rare exceptions, knowing what you need to prove is nine-tenths of the real work.</p>\r\n<p>The lost people out of Civilization's lost beginnings who first invented these ideas took longer to get there, from the bones of probability theory.&nbsp; But they did not have informal statements of where they should be going; and also they were not quite as smart as Asmodia is now, along some dimensions of thinkoomph if not others.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>So it doesn't take Asmodia much scribbling at all to see that if Conspiracy and Ordinary make the same predictions at the same strength then neither world can win out over the other one, to see the <em>abstract point</em> that if P(evidence ◁ hypothesis 1) = P(evidence ◁ hypothesis 2) then their ratio is 1:1 and the posterior odds are the same as the prior odds, while if P(evidence ◁ hypothesis 2) is 0 or just very tiny then as soon as you see the evidence you are convinced of hypothesis 1 no rather you're convinced that hypothesis 2 is false there could be&nbsp;<em>other hypotheses&nbsp;</em>even if Keltham only hinted at that it's&nbsp;<em>clear how to adapt the math</em> and she's&nbsp;<em>doing</em> it, she has enough of this Law to&nbsp;<em>invent the rest</em>, onward Asmodia goes to #5 and though she has no integral calculus with which to think in densities she imagines each of a thousand possible numbers between 0 and 10 down to a hundredth of fineness, and soon she has understood #5, or she thinks she's understood, no she <em>has</em> that's just the obvious thing it <em>means</em> mathematically, when you call it down to a hundredth part your prediction is ten times as strong there as if someone else called it down to a tenth,&nbsp;she is <em>doing </em>it she is inventing completing seeing the Law of Probability parsing the world with Keltham's own Sight, and the feeling that goes through her is glory.</p>",

It's hard to see from a mortal angle, but gods are doing Asmodeus favors who would not have been expected to do Asmodeus favors. Cayden Cailean gifted Pilar with the ability to track down every spy for Iomedae in Egorian, as long as she threw a party for them before kicking them out of the country, instead of executing them. That's what she was doing in Egorian. Broom's god - this is secret from Keltham, but permitted to know in the project - <em>teleported every diamond anywhere in Nidal to Broom</em>, at the same time as Asmodeus sent Maillol a vision saying we should set up near Ostenso where there's some kind of divine interdiction. Nethys warned us of the Zon-Kuthon attack.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's hard for mortals to know for certain what the gods are doing. But there's a thing that<em> would</em> have been something a heretic might have said a week ago, which was: if Asmodeus is destined to win,&nbsp;<em>why don't the other gods act like they know that?&nbsp;</em>Why do they oppose Asmodeus? They don't have the excuse of being mortal and stupid and scared of pain; they should submit, if they see how it's destined to end, or I guess try to let Rovagug out if they're too opposed to submit. But in that we have the start of our answer - Asmodeus doesn't want them to let Rovagug out, and so He has left hidden from them the ultimate result He sees. When Good gods tell their priests that Asmodeus will not win in the end, they're telling the truth, as far as they know.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Or that's what was true a week ago. I think that Asmodeus is now beginning to show his hand. We are valued in Dis not for the work we'll do in this world, but for the work we'll do in Hell, where the gods<em> do</em> know that Asmodeus reigns totally supreme and that there is nothing to do to oppose Him. With more Law, it will be possible to create better devils.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That might seem like - an advantage, a substantial one even, but not a decisive one, not one that turns Cayden Cailean against Iomedae and has Nethys serving Asmodeus in the absence of prophecy. Do you see why it's a bigger advantage than that?\"</p>",

And Ione believes Nethys to have charged her with helping the project succeed, and with making it visible to Keltham that the project has the backing of many gods - he'd be suspicious if it were just Asmodeans.

They asked her at the end if she wanted to stay and she said 'no' and they said 'we knew that would be your answer'. She is meant to bring that little that Elysium has to teach us with her to Hell.

A world or a theory or a way things can be, has a limited resource like money, like it has one gold piece total divided into a hundred coppers, which it has to spend on all the possibilities that it wants to claim credit for having predicted.&nbsp; I can't let you spin the coin and then say, Queen has 100% probability, Text also has 100% probability, that adds up to 200%.&nbsp; That's <em>why</em> they try to train dath ilani out of assigning more probability afterwards, than they would beforehand, it's why that's <em>contrary to the nature of Probability's Law,</em> if you assign more probability to a happening, after hearing that it happened, then when you add up all the probabilities you'd assign to all the happenings afterwards, you'll get way over 100%.&nbsp; Only if you do it in advance are you guaranteed to have it add up to 100%.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Golarion doesn't understand that Law.&nbsp; Golarion doesn't&nbsp;<em>know</em> that Law.&nbsp; Which means that everybody who's got a belief in their minds, is looking at, whatever happens, and trying to convince themselves, sure, that thing there, that is just what ought to happen in the world I think I'm living in, that should happen with 100% probability.&nbsp; They'd say that for anything just the same.&nbsp; So if you try to - turn that back into coherent math - it says that every outcome has the same probability, and if there's five outcomes, maybe each of them gets 20%, after you're done telling somebody it can't be 100% for each.&nbsp; But 20% for each of the same five outcomes is the same as if you just said 'I don't know' for each of them, instead of, in every case, there being a clever way to twist things around to make it sound like that thing is totally what should have happened.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The poetry Keltham quoted us for #1, I suspect if he said it in his own language it would rhyme, or there's a version of it that does, it had that feel to it, and I think I've got it memorized by now:&nbsp; <em>Your strength in the Way is your ability to be more confused by fiction than by reality. &nbsp;If you're equally good at explaining any outcome you can see, that's the same as not knowing anything.</em>&nbsp; It's not about how good you are at explaining away whatever happens, the only thing that - focuses, concentrates - the&nbsp;<em>limited supply</em> of what you can predict, into some predictions and not others - is that your explanations will sound&nbsp;<em>more</em> plausible for some things and&nbsp;<em>less</em> plausible for others, if there aren't some things you <em>can't</em> explain, that's the same as not being able to predict anything <em>will</em> happen, because you can't predict anything <em>won't</em> happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Explaining and predicting are the same thing to a dath ilani,</em> the degree to which a belief says, 'I'm great at explaining that, you should credit me for being totally compatible with that thing you saw', is, to the dath ilani, just the same number as the probability that got put on there, and probability is&nbsp;<em>conserved,</em> so you&nbsp;<em>can't be equally good at explaining everything.</em>&nbsp; To predict reality you have to be the sort of person who, if you were told a fiction instead, would go 'wait what I can't explain that thing how surprising' instead of coming up with a clever explanation of that thing you were told that wasn't real.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Ione thought that only #6 and #7 were going to be deadly to Asmodeanism.&nbsp; She's wrong.&nbsp; All seven are going to cause problems if the others in class really understand them.&nbsp; Everything that people see, they're trying to explain how their version of Asmodeanism predicts that thing, so Asmodeanism can claim credit for having predicted it, but if they'd seen something very different, they'd predict that too.&nbsp; Keltham's world trains Keepers out of that&nbsp;<em>all the way</em> and it trains people like Keltham four-fifths out of the way of doing that, and when you've started practicing with numbers and maths for some things, it affects all the rest of your thinking, the way you think in words.&nbsp; I remember&nbsp;<em>seeing</em> it when I wore the headband, it was so vivid then and it's faded now but I remember what I saw, the way that - the beliefs inside me - were trying to warp and distort themselves and pretend to shove more probability into the things that they knew had already happened, that they'd never have predicted or never have predicted that strongly, and the more that people are lying to themselves the more that distortion is going to be holding all the lies in place while they try to&nbsp;<em>suck</em> the credit of being right out of whatever-happened by explaining it - and dath ilanism <em>trains that out of people,</em> Keltham's going to make people play some game and when they're done playing the game they'll do that <em>less</em> and then everything that was held in place before becomes shakier - if you had a headband like the one I borrowed, you'd be able to visualize the right Law as math at the same time you watched your own mind trying to do it wrong -\"</p>\r\n<p>(There's no obvious sign that Asmodia is ever going to stop talking about problem #1 in particular.)</p>",

Many of my subordinates in the Asmodean hierarchy, from time to time, find it in their best interest to tell their own subordinates that their project is of vast value to Cheliax, to Hell, to Asmodeus, or of course, to me.&nbsp; In most cases they speak falsely, and in many of those, dishonestly.&nbsp; I don't consider this a flaw in my regime.&nbsp; If you are weak enough of mind to believe what you should not believe, you deserve what you get.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"This does create a problem of justified skepticism within those very rare projects that <em>are</em> of vast importance.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I hope this problem to be easily corrected, when I say that I am not in the habit of visiting on behalf of those overenthusiastic subordinates to address their underlings and back up their stories.&nbsp; As, perhaps, a clever mind might expect some important people would do, if the project was actually important.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Consider it confirmed from my own mouth and affirmed by my presence, that the Queen of Cheliax considers this project to be possibly <em>vastly </em>important.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Getting information out of Hell is often harder than torturing it out of paladins.&nbsp; They will not tell us of prices in Dis, but we can learn buyers.&nbsp; Your new owners are of rarefied heights.&nbsp; It seems that Hell also considers you, and I do mean you personally, to be potentially important.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"With matters indeed being that important, after walking around and seeing the disarray things are in, I've decided that this project is&nbsp;<em>not</em> ready to resume operations today.&nbsp; You are not organized, you are not actually rested, you have not rehearsed your new stories, and you are not caught up on your paperwork.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Keltham is currently a statue resting in his bed.&nbsp; This is not usually an option for deceiving important people, because they have some notion of the current date, and will notice if days suddenly go missing.&nbsp; In this case, nobody does seem to have informed Keltham of the current date at any point, according to his transcripts.&nbsp; Let's not tell him for a while longer unless he asks.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The key resource that this project burns with every working day is not some timer in the outside world, but Keltham's time aware and learning.&nbsp; There is no point in spending that resource while you are not in good condition to make use of it.&nbsp; I do not think you should skip more than one day like this at a time, Keltham may notice that you change too much from night to dawn if you do this often; but for this day, and mayhap the day after Keltham's next true day, it will give you a chance to catch up while waiting on your Rings of Sustenance.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The Nap Stack was a clever idea, dear little ambitious Asmodia.&nbsp; But you are not as yet any match for the cleverness of myself, nor Keltham when he puts his mind to it.&nbsp; And no, that is not a problem you could solve by stealing my crown from me, it is a skill that enhancement alone does not convey.&nbsp; The Nap Stack was clever, but it was not cleverness <em>enough </em>to save you had there been trouble.&nbsp; You are not ready, this minute, if Keltham starts taking matters seriously when next he wakes.&nbsp; You are not ready, even, if he asks for a Fox's Cunning while Ione has not yet solved her riddle.&nbsp; There is a terrible gap between being clever, and being clever enough.&nbsp; To contain and deceive Keltham you must learn to be clever <em>enough</em>.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Use today to get better organized.&nbsp; Though each of you must <em>actually </em>get three hours' rest, this time; your Queen commands it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh, and also this:\"</p>\r\n<p>\"While I have no intention of disturbing Carissa's experiments while they yet seem to be bearing fruit, there are limits to merciful experiments.&nbsp; Should you knowingly, deliberately, and unambiguously betray Hell's vital interests here, then, after you have been executed and your owner asks after your life, let them see this within your thoughts:&nbsp; That the Queen of Cheliax did instruct them in Asmodeus's name and as His incentive to make you suffer the most they possibly can, even at the cost of their own profit.&nbsp; Be it clear, I am not talking about the kind of betrayal you can accomplish by accident or while trying even slightly not to, I mean deliberately attempting to enlighten Keltham or selling out the site to Lastwall.&nbsp; With all the talk of diminished punishment going around, accompanied by other talk of pride and vast rewards, it seemed prudent to remind you that there are limits.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If Carissa achieves even a tenth of her ambitions within her lifetime, if you contribute even the fiftieth part of the work towards that, there is not one Asmodean among you who could not be a Duchess in the new Golarion we would conquer.&nbsp; That in life, and after to be among the higher devils in Hell, coming to it already a being of Law.&nbsp; Though Asmodia, I'm given to understand, has already had jurisdiction of her own fate claimed by my colleague the Most High, which I will not dispute.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"As I confirm what Carissa told you of this project's importance, I also confirm what she told you of the rewards if you succeed, such as fall within the Queen's hands to give.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"<em>Now</em> you are dismissed.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Queen of Cheliax is gone.</p>",

Permanent cheerfulness is not a trope, it has no clear Conspiracy objective, it feels fake and it <em>is</em> fake but it's not meant to be deceptive.</p>\r\n<p>Can he put his finger on anything about why the interaction felt scripted?</p>\r\n<p>It felt&nbsp;<em>rushed.</em></p>\r\n<p>Counterarguendo:&nbsp; It was an emergency.&nbsp; They <em>were</em> rushing.</p>\r\n<p>It felt optimized for making sure Keltham heard everything he needed to hear.</p>\r\n<p>Counterarguendo:&nbsp; Everyone talking knew that he was going to be surprised and alarmed and were, in fact, optimizing heavily for making sure Keltham didn't freak out about their back-and-forth.</p>\r\n<p>It felt&nbsp;<em>too clean,</em> like, giving that everyone had been doing their parts <em>separately </em>to keep him informed, there should've been more stumbles and messiness in their conversation.</p>\r\n<p>Counterarguendo:&nbsp; Keltham has had plenty of smooth conversations both here and in Civilization wherein nothing obviously disruptive or messy happens for up to five minutes at a time, and this was less time than that.</p>\r\n<p>It felt <em>coordinated, </em>like everyone had worked together in advance on making sure that all the information they wanted Keltham to see was present in that interaction, and finished its delivery exactly when Asmodia showed up.</p>\r\n<p>Counterarguendo:&nbsp; Hindsight, Keltham; would you also have said that if Asmodia had walked in the room right before Peranza said anything, or would you have said that if you'd also gotten a chance to hear whatever the next speaker had to say?</p>\r\n<p>WELL IT INTUITIVELY FELT SCRIPTED, SO THERE.</p>\r\n<p>Counterarguendo:&nbsp; WELL META-INTUITIVELY YOU'RE ON SOME COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLANET AND YOUR INTUITIONS MIGHT HAVE SOME PROBLEMS SO THERE</p>\r\n<p>He could make up numbers, probabilities, but that itself feels like the wrong move.&nbsp; This doesn't feel like Conspiracy vs Tropes vs Ordinary, it feels like the real hypothesis is not in his starting set.</p>\r\n<p>If Keltham just goes purely on intuition...</p>\r\n<p>It feels like Asmodia had an Event last night that changed her outwardly apparent personality and gave her mastery of Probability, an Event they <em>weren't</em> expecting and one that they were flatly prohibited from explaining to Keltham, and then they had to frantically scramble to make up a <em>cover story</em> for that and weren't very good at it.</p>\r\n<p>Keltham doesn't remember exact wordings but, if they were expecting to need to pass a truthspell test later, among the things they could do, if they were truly desperate, was call in an eighth-circle wizard named Manohar from the front with the reputation Maillol described - a reputation Keltham possibly finds slightly more sympathetic than the Chelish seem to, that guy is living his best life - and have him <em>act out</em> the events they described with Asmodia, so that she'd be able to tell Keltham under truthspell that it had all happened.&nbsp; Either Maillol, Ione, and Asmodia are in on it and the others not, or also Pilar and Peranza, and, it sort of hurts to think but, probably Carissa too at that rate, because they'd know Keltham might turn to her for advice.</p>\r\n<p>Does he actually believe that scenario?</p>\r\n<p>The prior here is kinda low.</p>\r\n<p>It's low in Conspiracy and it's low in Ordinary.&nbsp; It's higher in the Tropes world where Asmodia may still be due to acquire a Special Background.&nbsp; Her whole deal would never go in a Civilization-original eroLARP, fine, but neither would a lot of other things in Golarion.&nbsp; Maybe call them pseudo-tropes, fork off a theory where they look enough like dath ilan tropes to be initially recognizable but they're <em>not</em> the same tropes... that hugely widens a prior space that was already way too populated with potential patterns.&nbsp; But maybe the theory will start to make sense over time.</p>\r\n<p>Something else happened to Asmodia, and they had to frantically&nbsp;scramble to cover it up.</p>\r\n<p>Can he figure out what else would probably be true in that world, and how to test it?</p>",

She needs to figure out how Chelish people can be dath ilani without exploding, and that might require some fundamental revisions to Asmodeanism as taught to humans, because Asmodeanism as taught to Lawful beings is necessarily very different and no one is willing to just sit her down and tell her what it is. It is possible it will also require revisions to Hell, which - she's aware that objectively her odds of success at that can't look very high, but it's not like who rules the various layers of Hell never changes, or like the archdevils don't have a great deal of power within their own domains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(It occurred to her yesterday, uncomfortably so, that an easier way to get what she wants might in fact be to donate her vast sums of money and go to Axis with Keltham. It's not tempting. Ironically it's not tempting because of Good impulses she's indulging as much as because of Evil ones; going to Axis might be an all right way for Carissa to go about her work having lost a part of herself but not all the parts of herself, but most people who try to do things in the world and don't end up with a billion gold about it will go to Hell, and so Hell needs to be able to use them.

The value of consulting that predictor is zero; being the same amount surprised by everything is the same as knowing nothing - and I think actually maybe that's the most satisfying definition of knowing nothing, that the value of consulting you is zero.\" She puts up an illusion with her notes as she talks; she is talking fast and seems a bit nervous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(She is not on the light punishment regime, but she doesn't think that's why she's nervous, alter Tonia is just worried she'll get fired if she said something stupid.)</p>",

There are advantages to a narrow portfolio of worlds on which you intervene; gods that are stretched thinner face sharper tradeoffs, and Asmodeus' great power cancels this disadvantage but could instead be applied to turning it into an advantage. But while to a Good god, the existence of a god with the same values in another world is almost exactly as good as being there yourself, this is not true to an Evil god, or at least not true to Asmodeus; and so where Iomedae would sooner raise another hero in another world than colonize it with Her own church, if She had the chance to do either, Asmodeus works in both of them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Golarion is nonetheless a substantial and important part of Asmodeus's portfolio; He worked very hard on Cheliax. He is observing closely the events unfolding in the interdiction zone, even forbidden as He is from interfering.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He has questions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This squirrel over here, a fairly pleasing squirrel, got selected as an oracle by Cayden Cailean, and has maintained her absolute loyalty to Asmodeus and might even be making some genuine progress on becoming the shape Asmodeus wants squirrels to be. This squirrel right nearby burns with conviction in her faith in Him, and with impossible-to-read-from-this-angle plans to alter Hell, while somehow being a cleric of Irori's now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(Most mortals who want to alter Hell do not have an idea that serves Asmodeus, and in fact it's out of disloyalty to Asmodeus that they imagine His Hell in need of any alteration. But Asmodeus is not impossible to impress, and the scope of his squirrels' current ambitions in Golarion looks like something that would impress Him, if they pull it off; certainly He'd see it tested whether they had anything else interesting in them. And Irori has at least moderately good taste, in picking His favorites, though He doesn't, generally, pick loyal Asmodeans.)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Asmodeus's intervention budget is large, but substantially expended in setting up Cheliax in the first place; it would be costly to Him to act, and also unwise, because He doesn't understand why things are going so well and could easily accidentally make them go worse. But He watches, and He does float, generally, that He'll do information trades relating to His nest of squirrels.</p>",

Or some discover that nature in themselves after they're in a relationship like ours, though Pilar seems to not have that route available since she figured it out about herself already.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I think probably if you don't end up growing in a direction where you want her and Subirachs thinks you'd be good for her, then she'll get picked up by a very important Asmodean priest, given the circles she's moving in these days. But right now even if any of them noticed her they'd, uh, wait and see if you do grow in that direction, given the givens.\"</p>",

But the <em>object</em> of torture is the shaping of a soul, to be more useful, and closer to satisfactory; some torture is probably for the shaping of the torturer, not the victim, and it's still plainly Asmodean, to torture someone who is mine because I happen to want to and it doesn't undermine Asmodeus's goals.</p>\r\n<p>But a slave of Asmodeus who just wants to cause their slaves maximum suffering at all times is indeed more like Zon-Kuthon than like Asmodeus; while perhaps bounds on their conduct can properly be placed only by those above them, and only on their own whims or insofar as it serves Asmodeus, it seems like they'd be a <em>better </em>slave of Asmodeus if they tortured their slaves exactly insofar as it improved them, in a manner that improved them, and thus left Asmodeus richer and not poorer.

Maybe torture makes minds&nbsp;<em>more predictable to Asmodeus?&nbsp;</em>Tortured minds are more alike, and so more useful? ....that's just a clever way to get back to her favored hypothesis that torture makes devils more valuable. Maybe torture makes the Good gods get all mad at Asmodeus and that in in some sense directly useful. ...also doesn't feel persuasive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- maybe torture does not cause Asmodeus to have more of anything else he cares about, and the only reason there is torture in Hell is because of Asmodeus's fondness for torture, like Zon-Kuthon, if not wholly like Zon-Kuthon because He does apparently care about several other things. In which case there is torture in Hell because Asmodeus likes it that way and no new way of training devils could improve the situation because Asmodeus doesn't regard it as potentially benefitting from improvement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>That&nbsp;</em>feels like an actually dangerous heresy, the kind of thing where if she believed it she'd - she's not sure what she'd do how about she stops thinking about that. What is it with her new urge to when she thinks of something dangerous keep thinking about it, like there's always a safe answer at the other end.</p>\r\n<p>....though the best time to have unsafe thoughts is right now while they can be corrected promptly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Okay.</p>\r\n<p>If the point of torture is that it makes Asmodeus weaker, makes His triumph less likely, but He likes it, so it happens anyway even though it makes devils worse, then Carissa thinks Iomedae kind of has a point. Carissa in that world is not going to betray the project because she mostly cares about Carissa and they are competent to make that not in the interests of Carissa, but she'd cease feeling like Good was obviously and plainly her enemy. Good would kind of deserve to win, if Asmodeus wasn't<em> trying to</em> because He was <em>so busy torturing people in ways that undermined his other goals</em>. The contempt that Carissa feels for anyone else who undermines Asmodeus, she feels for this hypothetical Asmodeus, undermining himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There; she thought it; now it's obviously not the answer to the puzzle, so keep thinking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The answer is not that a Hell with torture leaves Asmodeus weaker than a Hell without it; now that she's actually thought it it's self-refuting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So it leaves Asmodeus stronger, or at least the same.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But she's not supposed to just again give the answer 'to make devils better', that would be - failing to engage with what the High Priestess is trying to say to her -&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What does pain have to do with tyranny?</p>\r\n<p>Well, someone who can hurt you without reprisal is above you. Maybe that's important; maybe in a sense there's no real chain of command, if everyone's seamlessly working together to advance Asmodeus's goals, and for it to be a tyranny at all it has to be clear who can hurt who. That explains why torture is allowed; it doesn't explain why it's a particularly common proclivity. Is torture <em>unique </em>in having that property? Or maybe another way of thinking about it is - is everything which has that property torture?<br /><br />If so, then this tea was torture; it was, after all, orchestrated in significant part to make it clear to the girls on the project who could hurt who. And the elaborate rituals of formality among nobles are torture too; they are after all about establishing who can hurt who without reprisal, communicated with every degree of incline of one's head -</p>\r\n<p>- yeah, that's not a useful definition. Torture is one way to communicate that, but not the only one. But maybe the others bottom out in torture. Or, they could just bottom out in final execution, but that would be horrible and wasteful; better for everyone if they bottom out in torture. Except people like Asmodia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Carissa's authority on the project, she is well aware, is located in significant part in the girls' knowledge that an experiment is being run, and that if they're incompetent even when barely punished then they'll be properly punished. She's doing without much torture, but not without the threat of it; the threat of it underlies the whole thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That feels like it might be as close to an answer as she's going to get on the spot, but the thought of backtracing inferences into spoken words is suddenly quite intimidating. Well, presumably the Grand High Priestess is reading her mind.</p>",

Torture is also the bedrock of the Asmodean tyranny; if you could not use torture for punishment, then Hell would resemble just - one of Keltham's organizations, that fires you if it's displeased with you, and considers itself otherwise to have only the authority you agreed to. There probably wouldn't be discipline problems, if I had a little shard of Hell that merely fired those who displeased or disobeyed, but that's because they'd be tortured once fired; the shard would still be using torture as its bedrock, just making other parts of Hell actually do it. That would be unacceptable, I think. I don't know why. It feels intuitively unacceptable, like a tyranny trying to pretend it isn't one. If that shard of Hell produced much of value to Asmodeus, maybe those who owned it could afford to obfuscate the tyranny - but -</p>\r\n<p>- oh, I have it, it wouldn't work. Humans, who are very very flawed, might treat 'you are treated well here, but could be fired' as substantially different from 'you're tortured for disobedience', and might flock to my shard if they were qualified, but if it's just an obfuscation then a more careful and more Lawful being wouldn't see a difference, it wouldn't produce different strategies in response, it's a dead end. It has to be actually different, to do anything actually valuable with beings that are not starting as incoherent as humans. If the tyranny is founded in something different, something that uses dath ilani better, it has to be founded in that all the way to its core.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>if you were building it out of Carissae you could have its currency of power be intelligence. The weakest devils and petitioners are very stupid, and by proving themselves they are granted more intelligence, having demonstrated that they'll actually serve better with it, and the punishment for failure is for those enhancements to be stripped away; pride and tyranny and slavery, with pain only in whatever place it needs occupy for Asmodeus's other purposes. That might only work on people who are very like me. Then again, the appeal doesn't need to be anywhere near universal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My answer is that if I'm not doing that with torture, I have to figure out what <em>does</em> do it, and ideally does it in a manner just as pleasing to Asmodeus and at no higher cost, because torture is&nbsp;<em>cheap,&nbsp;</em>and if it doesn't suit His will for Hell then no pragmatic concerns about the survival of Cheliax in this new world will make it possible, and if it does suit His will for Hell then it should be done. Though -&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- such a thing wouldn't be granted to me unless I am such that it does not injure the order of Hell, to grant it to me. And right now I'm not Asmodean enough or frankly Lawful Evil enough.\"</p>",

      "content": "<p>\"That's a legitimately fascinating question in trope mechanics.&nbsp; Suppose that the basic mechanism of the tropes is that something else looks over universes that would exist anyways, and drops Keltham in a world where, given the way Keltham predictably acts, things that resemble trope-patterns will happen around him.&nbsp; It seems incredibly likely that this happened&nbsp;<em>at least</em> with my being dropped on the Worldwound someplace I'd predictably run out of the cold into a building where Carissa would be the first person I found who could talk to me.&nbsp; It happened <em>at least</em> with my dropping into a universe with masochists in it, and one where my knowledge would be incredibly valuable, falling in the right margin between being obsolete and being too advanced for anyone there to understand.&nbsp; The question is whether universe selection happened with anything <em>else</em> than very basic and initial things like that.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It could be, for example, that the forces that selected my landing universe were also looking around for a world where Pilar delivers snacks - that they looked over a world with a Carissa with no Pilar and were like, not good enough, needs more Pilar, next universe please.&nbsp; Or it could be that those forces dropped me wherever with a Carissa, but it very naturally happens, without that needing to be further specified, that if you get a weird thing like me, some nearby gods look around and one of those gods is Cayden Cailean and Cayden's like 'well this project needs snacks' and then that happens.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If there's a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> of tropes, a lot of selection, running rampant about - or if the tropes are things that can continue to steer actively - though active steering is very much <em>not </em>what the answer would be in a dath ilani story - then we get into the realm of questions about, if Meritxell talks about Nocticula, does that&nbsp;<em>imply</em> Nocticula is more likely to show up?&nbsp; Can Meritxell&nbsp;<em>make</em> Nocticula show up?&nbsp; Does it only apply from Keltham's perspective, or also Carissa's, or even Gregoria's?\"</p>\r\n<p>\"It could be that the tropes operate&nbsp;<em>primarily</em> on whether Nocticula shows up at all, and then have a&nbsp;<em>secondary</em> effect of Meritxell happening to mention her.&nbsp; Meritxell happening to mention Nocticula, you might think, is then not something that makes Nocticula show up; rather, because Nocticula is going to show up, Meritxell happens to mention her.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"But even in this case, it doesn't mean Meritxell can't affect what happens.&nbsp; Maybe if Meritxell and every other researcher on the project and all the Security are like, nope, we're not mentioning anybody like that to Keltham, in case the tropes are real, the tropes are like, 'Can we drop Nocticula on this story in a foreshadowed way?&nbsp; No, because nobody's going to mention Nocticula', and the tropes give up and we don't have to deal with an incredibly persuasive demon lord.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Except now we have a&nbsp;<em>new</em> question - is there just&nbsp;<em>one</em> Keltham that gets dropped on a single Golarion, or a fixed quantity of Kelthams, or does <em>every Golarion that matches Keltham to the satisfaction of the tropes</em> get one?&nbsp; Because in the latter case, by being the sort of person who looks at this situation and has everybody get together to refuse to mention Nocticula, what you're doing is reducing the number of Golarions that get a Keltham at all, and if you think I'm net positive for Golarions, you super don't want to do <em>that.</em>\"</p>\r\n<p>\"In calculating this, obviously, you're not supposed to say anything like, 'But we obviously already have a Keltham, he's right here, and if we refuse to mention future entities like Nocticula, he'll still be here, it's too late for the tropes to take him back', because your decision exists in two places at once and has two synchronized effects.&nbsp; The first place is here and now.&nbsp; The second place is in a prediction about this world that the tropes made before dropping me here.&nbsp; A prediction where the tropes asked, 'Well, what will people like Meritxell decide, <em>when they think they've already got a Keltham who the tropes can't take back anymore?</em>' and if the tropes predict you won't mention any future demon lords and will make it impossible for required events to happen in a duly foreshadowed fashion, you don't get a Keltham.&nbsp; If you're the sort of person who thinks that the tropes can't take back a Keltham you already have, you don't get one.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"All this is the shard of Law after Utility and before Coordination, what we'd call the <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/logical_dt/?l=5kv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">theory of logical decisions</a>, meaning, decisions that are about logical facts and identified with logical facts and which we evaluate in terms of their logical consequences.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"But pending knowing a lot of other stuff, I'd say that, even if tropes are everywhere, you <em>shouldn't </em>avoid mentioning things like Nocticula... uh, <em>unless</em> demon lords actually directly notice when you talk about them, which, in retrospect, I should have checked before going into this whole long lecture here.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"And I'm mostly at tropes not being that ubiquitous and not running foreshadowing in that particular way, after there was no conflict with the queen, Carissa made her afterlife arrangements just fine, and wasn't a hidden cleric, etcetera.&nbsp; And in that case you again shouldn't refrain from telling me about demon lords, unless, again, they directly hear when we talk about them.&nbsp; Do they?\"</p>",

She's pretty sure it's not 'I want to bite <em>you&nbsp;</em>when you get distracted and go off on a tangent about probability theory'; an important skill in Yaisa's line of work is reading whether someone is into that at least a little under the right circumstances, and Keltham isn't.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Well.

      "content": "<p>In his morning lecture, Keltham makes a further run at Utility, called also Probable Utility or Expected Utility because the notion of a quantitative <em>utility</em> is meaningless without probabilities to multiply those utilities by.&nbsp; If you were working only with certainties, the&nbsp;<em>ordering</em> on your preferences would be all that existed; the notion of&nbsp;<em>comparable intervals</em> of wantingness is only useful when you can take fractions of outcomes and want about those.</p>\r\n<p>Value-of-information is an example of one concept that exists under Probable Utility, hopefully simple in an intuitive sense, but pretty important in practice.&nbsp; Keltham ran into that not long ago when a slightly more Civilized person of Cheliax offered to pay him to do something, Keltham thought that price sounded much too high and didn't have any Fair Pricing spells left and wrongly questioned her choice, and Keltham had forgotten to take into account that what he was trying would be a <em>new</em> experiment whose outcome would give her information relevant to her future choices, and let her make those choices better.</p>\r\n<p>Value-of-information isn't quite as trivial as it might sound, as a matter of Law, because what you're actually doing is&nbsp;<em>calculating the effect of this decision on your own future decisions,</em> not because it modifies what you want or&nbsp;<em>forces</em> your future self to make a particular decision, but because your future self will then have more information and that is something your present self knows.&nbsp; It is a kind of <em>extrinsic</em> curiosity, you might call it, that would appear in the calculations of ideal-agents who never&nbsp;<em>felt</em> curious about anything.</p>\r\n<p>Also in that interaction, Keltham asked her the next morning under Fairness what would have been the fair price for the service Keltham <em>thought</em> she was trying to buy, if it had existed in isolation and not been informative, because he wanted to know if he'd also been wrong to question even the price he'd <em>thought</em> she was offering.&nbsp; Keltham paid her a silver for that information, not because he desperately needed that information or expected to make at least one silver from using it in the future, but just because his brain would've kept bugging him about it otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>In reasoning like that, in <em>feeling curious,</em> in putting a value on information that you might not <em>even vaguely</em> expect to need as much as you offered to pay, in buying information where you predictably won't make a profit, is a person being unLawful?&nbsp; Had Keltham aspired to be improving his coherence and Lawfulness, on this occasion, should he have tried to calculate the real-life importance of knowing this information?&nbsp; Including, maybe, its value for Keltham calibrating his judgment of similar prices in Cheliax, or the prospect that some use for the info would come up that Keltham just hadn't foreseen - it doesn't have to be a shortsighted or blind calculation, when you ask about the value of learning.&nbsp; But if that calculation would have shown the information's expected future profit at less than a silver, was Keltham acting unLawfully in buying it for a silver?</p>\r\n<p>It won't be a terrible judgment on him, if they say yes.&nbsp; Keltham knows he's not a Keeper.&nbsp; The question he's posing is whether they think this is something a Keeper would ever do.&nbsp; Close your eyes, come to a judgment about that, raise your hand to a corresponding height; then open your eyes, and argue.&nbsp; Tier-2s speak first if more than one person wants to speak at a time.</p>",
