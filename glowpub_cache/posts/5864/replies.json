'Divide every point by whatever p^N sums to between 0 and 1' - can I ask you to expand on that?\"</blockquote>\r\n<p><br />Keltham shall be happy to do so!&nbsp; Thank you for providing any feedback on where anyone is getting lost.</p>\r\n<p>As a simple example, take the case of N=1, so p^N=p.&nbsp; If you graph that, you get a straight line from likelihood=0 at <em>p=</em>0, to likelihood 1 at <em>p</em>=1.&nbsp; That graph looks like a triangle filling half of a square with side 1.&nbsp; So by visual reasoning, the sum 1/INF * [0/INF + 1/INF + 2/INF + ... + INF/INF] = 1/2 in the end.</p>\r\n<p>Proof by dubious infinitary mathematics, now that they know the correct answer by simpler visual reasoning:</p>\r\n<pre>1 + 2 + ... + INF  =  INF*(INF+1)/2<br />   =&gt;   &nbsp;1/INF * [0/INF + 1/INF + 2/INF + ... + INF/INF]<br />       = 1/INF * [1/INF * { 1 + 2 + ... + INF }]<br />       = 1/INF * [1/INF * { INF*(INF + 1)/2 }]<br />       = INF * (INF + 1) / (INF * INF * 2)<br />   &nbsp;   = 1/2</pre>\r\n<p>Then to find a probability distribution proportional to that prior-times-likelihood object, but which sums to 1 to form the posterior, they divide the whole thing by 1/2 or multiply it by 2.</p>\r\n<pre>1/INF&nbsp; *&nbsp; [0/INF + 1/INF + ... + INF/INF]&nbsp; /&nbsp; (1/2)&nbsp; &nbsp;= 1.</pre>\r\n<p><br />As Keltham is saying this, it occurs to him that it may not be obvious to the candidates why you'd do that, depending on what got covered in previous Probability classes and how well.&nbsp; He'll expand on that too.</p>\r\n<p>If they were just tracking, say, 1/2 prior probability of propensity 1/3 versus 1/2 prior probability of propensity 2/3, the prior-times-likelihood object would look like {1/2 * 1/3, 1/2 * 2/3} and the sum over the prior-times-likelihood object would look like {1/6 + 1/3} = 1/2.&nbsp; Which is just what it should be, because if you start with 50-50 on 1/3 vs. 2/3 then your prior probability of seeing the ball go LEFT is indeed 1/2.</p>\r\n<p>Conversely, the prior-time-likelihood object for seeing RIGHT is {1/2 * (1 - 1/3), 1/2 * (1 - 2/3)} = {1/2 * 2/3, 1/2 * 1/3} = {1/3, 1/6} again summing to 1/2.</p>\r\n<p>This should look like it makes lots of sense.&nbsp; On priors, you think either the ball goes left, or the ball goes right, but not both, nor neither, so your&nbsp;<em>prior</em> probability of LEFT plus your probability of RIGHT should sum to 1.</p>\r\n<p>But after actually seeing the ball go LEFT and updating on that, you throw out all the possible worlds from your probability distribution where the ball went RIGHT, and live only inside the worlds where the ball went LEFT.&nbsp; After seeing LEFT, then, <em>within</em> this kind of hypothesis where you're not questioning the whole setup from outside, you're <em>certain </em>that the ball went LEFT.&nbsp; It's now probability 1 that the ball went LEFT.&nbsp; The probability 1, of what is real, is divided up among the surviving worlds; the surviving worlds should have probability&nbsp;<em>proportional</em> to their prior times their likelihood, but&nbsp;<em>summing</em> to 1.</p>\r\n<p>So you divide through {1/6, 1/3} by its total probability of 1/2 to get {1/3, 2/3} as the&nbsp;<em>posterior</em> probability.</p>\r\n<p>In symbolic terms, there's:</p>\r\n<pre>P(\"propensity 1/3\") = 50%<br />P(\"propensity 2/3\") = 50%<br />P(TRUE) = P(\"propensity 1/3\") + P(\"propensity 2/3\") = 1<br />P(LEFT ◁ \"prp 1/3\") = 1/3<br />P(LEFT)<br />&nbsp; = P(LEFT &amp; \"prp 1/3\") + P(LEFT &amp; \"prp 2/3\")<br />&nbsp; = P(LEFT ◁ \"prp 1/3\")*P(\"prp 1/3\") + P(LEFT ◁ \"prp 2/3\")*P(\"prp 2/3\")<br />&nbsp; = 1/3*50% + 2/3*50% = 1/2<br />P(\"prp 1/3\" ◁ LEFT) = P(\"prp 1/3\" &amp; LEFT) / P(LEFT) = 1/6 / (1/2) = 1/3<br />P(\"prp 1/3\" ◁ LEFT) + P(\"prp 2/3\" ◁ LEFT) = P(TRUE) = 1</pre>\r\n<p><br />So to get the <em>posterior</em> probability on all the hypotheses between 0 and 1, after seeing N balls go left, they take the prior-times-likelihood object, which is 1/INF * [ (0/INF)^N + (1/INF)^N + ... + (INF/INF)^N ], and divide it through by its&nbsp;<em>sum</em> so that the probability inside the whole thing sums to 1.&nbsp; If we started out certain that the ball has a propensity between 0 and 1 to go LEFT or RIGHT, and then we observe N LEFTs, we end up still certain that the ball has <em>some </em>propensity between 0 and 1 to go LEFT.</p>\r\n<p>So the question then becomes: &nbsp;1/INF * [ (0/INF)^N + (1/INF)^N + ... + (INF/INF)^N ] = ?</p>\r\n</details></blockquote>\r\n<p>Now, before they try to prove a correct answer, they should, of course, first figure out what the correct answer <em>is,</em> so they can prove it.</p>\r\n<p>The correct answer in this case obviously has to be that it sums to 1/(N+1).</p>\r\n<p>Why?&nbsp; Well, you saw N balls go LEFT.&nbsp; On the first round, that had probability 1/2.&nbsp; On the second round, you thought there was a 2/3 chance of seeing LEFT, and then you saw it, so your <em>joint </em>probability over all predictions is now 1/2 * 2/3 = 1/3 after seeing two LEFT.&nbsp; On the third round, you think there's a 3/4 chance of seeing LEFT, so your joint probability goes to 1/2 * 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/4 after seeing three LEFT.</p>\r\n<p>Since your joint probability of seeing N balls go LEFT is 1/(N+1), the sum from 0 to 1 of an infinite number of points each with weight p^N for how much they predicted seeing N balls going LEFT, must clearly <em>end up</em> as 1/(N+1).</p>",
