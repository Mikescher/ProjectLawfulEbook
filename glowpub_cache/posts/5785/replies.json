That's good. It should be easier to think of questions that don't reveal anything if she doesn't have to also filter for being incredibly insightful.

She was so desperate for it that when a chance to ask questions came up, she tried to ask one mostly just to show off:</p>\r\n<p>\"Of course if the project is so important we should all be getting intelligence headbands, right, and I can put that impertinent demand in fancy probability language to prove I understood the homework too! I didn't stop to think that economic reasons were a trivial concern and that the real thing I should be worried about was <em>fooling Keltham</em>, even though you just gave a giant speech about how the important thing was <em>fooling Keltham</em>. So obviously I'm a complete idiot and you should never trust me with anything at all!\"</p>\r\n<p>That's not actually what she said, but it might as well have been. They didn't torture her for it at all which was super weird, but now alter Willa is 'studious, shy, and hesitant.' Forever. And she has to mentally run all her questions by Asmodia now, of course, to make sure they aren't suicidally stupid to say out loud. And she can guess that means if she ever actually has a good one it'll get given to someone else who isn't supposed to be 'shy and hesitant.'</p>\r\n<p>She could choke herself with a rusty spoon.</p>\r\n<p>She messed up and she knows it and she's mostly just sulking, angry at herself. There's a simmering annoyance with Asmodia for forcing alter Willa on her, and still a lingering resentment towards Sevar for capturing most of her soul-profits, but in the end the reason she can't be a model <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">student</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">actor</span> agent is that she's too obsessed with being special and not obsessed enough with winning. It's a terrible failing in her and it's worse that she knows deep down that it's still true, it's not something she knows how to change.</p>\r\n<p>She's not going to be able to distinguish herself to Keltham by asking clever questions, and honestly even if she was she maybe couldn't trust herself to do it safely. Instead she'll have to distinguish herself to Asmodia by <em>thinking</em> useful thoughts.

She wouldn't have to feel so concerned about having that impulse, if the way of knowing true things without breaking was to earn them.)<br /><br /><br />...except, wait, if you prove it in a context where you can guess as many times as you want, you haven't proved that you'll consistently land on the right answer with the right information at all, you've only proven something about the scope of your imagination, which might be useful for finding right answers, but <em>also&nbsp;</em>seems like it would lead to lots of wrong ones.</p>\r\n<p>Hm.</p>",

Even if it is, she isn't really feeling gregarious at the moment. She'll let the conversation about Sevar mostly flow over her.</p>\r\n<p>What she wants to do is use mage hand to play with her quill; it's one of her favorite ways to destress (and won't it be pretty to watch once she gets that Arcane Sight.) But doing that would probably draw attention that she doesn't want to deal with. It might not even be adequately shy. She'll have to stew without assistance instead.</p>\r\n<p>Willa wants to be special, and she's made negative progress at that since getting on this project. She isn't especially good at the work (yet), she couldn't make clever statements even if she could think of any, and most of her superiors already dislike her. She feels frustrated, like she doesn't have the right tools to solve the problem. Alter Keltham who she could whine to about this problem would tell her to step outside of the solution space.</p>\r\n<p>What's special about Willa? If she gets hired, she's going to be selling her soul; that isn't special, especially not in Cheliax, but also selling an option on her sold soul is. Is it useful somehow? She can't think of how, especially since all the other new hires will be in the same boat, but it's a persistent idea all the same. Selling an option on a soul feels like it was definitely someone stepping outside of a solution space, but as far as she can tell it's not to her benefit. Hell is going to own her soul; in all respects it should probably act as normal until and unless the option is executed?</p>\r\n<p>What other especially unusual stuff has happened? People keep ominously mentioning the tropes, so they're probably something special, but without knowing anything else about what they are they aren't special in any useful way. Even the 2-4-6 'math looking back at you' angle doesn't help if you have no idea what you're trying to look at.</p>",

If 14s aren't wildly better at this then there's no way you'd use them. So the math is easier if you assert that we thought there'd be no difference, but I can't really imagine thinking that. But on the other hand, there's no math you can do on the thing I just said - you would get wildly different answers if you started out thinking 14s are 5 times better versus if you think they're 100 times better - and I thought maybe there was some way to specify 'started out thinking 14s are at least 5 times better' but I'm actually not seeing it. I don 't know if that means there's no math directly for answering the question that would actually motivate my Civilization to do this experiment, or if there is but it's far more complicated than the starting math and we need to get that nailed down first.\"</p>",

So - I guess I feel like if .4 is more likely to be right than .5, I don't see why the hypothesis that covers a bigger space, that also includes the value that the true value is most likely to be closest to, becomes less likely just because that hypothesis also includes values that are much less likely to be right than some other narrower hypothesis. - I'm not sure I said all that right.\"</p>",

She'll try to avoid any dangerous topics about Cheliax or related things, but that just means she can talk about SCIENCE(!) instead.</p>\r\n<p>Her head is spinning with all the little details and digressions of lecture that were missed or had to be glossed over for time, but there's one question she has to ask Keltham first, she couldn't possibly resist this one, it's just too tempting. Maybe he even intended them to get insatiably curious.</p>\r\n<p>\"What's 'computer-science'? Can you tell us all about it?\"</p>",

But someone did it to Keltham, at some point, and now he's trying to do it to them.</p>\r\n<p>...which means she should try her best to let him do that, but out of concern for her ability to make it through this conversation, Korva is going to try to redirect him away from math anyway.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\"That would be cool, but no surprise that it's beyond us for now. As far as share language for lectures goes, I kind of expect there are pros and cons? I'm sure I picked up some things I wouldn't have picked up from a lecture in Taldane, but I think it also got me tripped up in places. I'd try to work through the connotations of some word I only had a vague sense of, and I'd end up unfolding it out into some long Taldane phrase before I felt like I maybe had a handle on it, and by the time I was done I'd have missed a sentence or two and be struggling to jump back in.\"</p>",
