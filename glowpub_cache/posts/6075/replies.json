You'd have to be an idiot, and you clearly aren't.</p>\r\n<p>And yet.</p>\r\n<p>My guess is that my theological advisors will tell me that herding souls from Abaddon to Hell is not a good idea for me, even if it does serve Asmodeus, because it also serves my own worst impulses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And yet.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She keeps the paper close to hand, the one where Asmodeus's instructions to her were written. She pulls it out. She reads out the first and last line.</p>\r\n<p>\"Serve Me well in this world and you shall be raised high in it. Come to Me in Hell without thought of other choices, as mortals once did in the days before they were cursed with their own wills, and you shall be among the most treasured of My possessions.</p>\r\n<p>That's - the real prophecy, such as it is, in this age without it.\"</p>",

For researchers, that means discussing with each other the merits and demerits of various plans for war, betting on them, and then doing your jobs and seeing who wins the bets. For everyone else, that means enabling the researchers in conducting their research without inconveniences of any kind. If you are directed by one researcher to inconvenience another researcher, you will not do that. You will, instead,&nbsp;<em>tell me</em>, and I will&nbsp;<em>personally ensure </em>that research goes uninterrupted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>You may be thinking, 'probably it is wiser not to go to Carissa Sevar in a remotely ambiguous case, because coming to the attention of powerful people is generally bad'.

This position is available to everyone who isn't a top-tier researcher; you have better things to do. The major job perk is that you'll be very valuable to me and I will not want to go through the hassle of finding another one. If you are interested, you may find me in my office after 2am; I expect to be busy until then.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Next! I notice this project has something of a<em> leaks </em>problem; Osirion knew far too much about it, and still does, and there are some fascinating rumors spreading in Egorian. The same policy applies for this as for inconveniences to my researchers: if you learn something, even if you're not sure if it's something, <em>tell me. </em>Eventually you will tell my predictor-secretary, once I've trained one. You will not be punished for wasting my time. You will die in agony if you knew something and decided not to mention it to anyone. Fake attempts to recruit you for espionage, or just to get you to share juicy rumors, will be made.\"</p>",

In hindsight it seems incredibly obvious that the statue plan would trigger some kind of challenge, and one that Asmodia made very little effort to prepare for seriously, and wasn't given orders by anybody in her chain of command otherwise <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">including the Queen and Most High, both of whom should've been paying far more regular visits and allocating far more resources to the most important Project in Cheliax.&nbsp; If they didn't otherwise have any +6 intelligence headbands available for Sevar, they should've statued some sixth or seventh circle wizard who was simply not as important as Sevar.</span></p>\r\n<p>Everything that happened in the Project after Sevar left seems predictable in hindsight and Sevar should've left more detailed orders about that instead of refusing to think about it.</p>\r\n<p>Everything that happened after Sevar left is pathetic.&nbsp; Pilar had the power to prevent all of this but doesn't like acting without orders.&nbsp; Pilar understands tropes, like Asmodia, and is a faithful Asmodean, unlike Asmodia, who could've advised Maillol and Subirachs.&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">If the Most High and the Queen don't want to put Pilar in charge they need to come run the Project themselves because</span> <em>nobody <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">else</span> with authority understands tropes</em> and idiot Securities are pressuring Yaisa into having sex with them and at some point somebody's going to go too far and Keltham is going to stomp into the fortress with an army just in time to rescue her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Nobody is keeping track of this because they don't like thinking about tropes.</em></p>\r\n<p>Systems in Cheliax look nothing like Hell and Cheliax should stop pretending that it has an Asmodeanism in hand that even slightly works.&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">You know the thing Keltham mentioned in animal breeding about how you need to breed chickens according to the success of the coop, because if you breed chickens by individual size you get chickens that bully others and steal their food and the group's output is actually weakened?&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; That's all Cheliax is, right now.</span>&nbsp; People can't think clearly about the consequences of current aspects of the system because they'll be labeled traitors if they do.&nbsp; Asmodia&nbsp;<em>is</em> a traitor, if you can call somebody that who doesn't even pretend to be loyal, and it should not have fallen to her to do the failure analysis on this shitshow.&nbsp; If Asmodeanism wants to change, it needs an actual loyal Asmodean who can say that everything's terrible.</p>\r\n<p>Asmodia isn't particularly spared from her own analysis; it notes that the apparent leader of the remaining Sevar loyalists had no Splendour that didn't come out of a spell and no idea how to run a political battle and didn't want to be there and wasn't loyal to Cheliax; that&rsquo;s not a good thing when a research manager&rsquo;s primary stat is supposed to be fighting Chelish political battles in order to prove her worthiness to be allowed to get any research done for Cheliax. &nbsp;Asmodia lied to herself about whether better roads would be any use to Cheliax, because she was uncomfortable doing anything that would give Cheliax a real military advantage; and managed to be muddled about that, <em>as was in her own interests</em> the moment that Sevar, the only person with any appreciation for&nbsp;<em>having bad slaves instead of muddled ones,</em> stepped out of the Project, and Asmodia's mind knew she could only obtain her goals by being muddled and not admitting to herself what she was doing.&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">The Queen and Most High know better than this too, and Asmodia does not understand why they abandoned this project to the likes of Maillol and Subirachs.&nbsp; Why are they even taking Sevar away to be punished this much?&nbsp; It's so obviously the wrong time!&nbsp; At least make it clear that Sevar is going to be okay when she comes back!&nbsp; So much of this political battle is being produced by uncertainty about whether Sevar is coming back at all, or will be the same Sevar when she does!&nbsp; Asmodia has a hard time believing that the Queen and Most High are doing this as a mistake and suspects some goal at work that Asmodia doesn't understand, but she's writing it down anyways just in case it actually is that much of a mistake, and to emphasize how much this unknown other goal is costing.</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Everyone</em>&nbsp;on this Project in anything like a management position&nbsp;<em>without exception</em> is a traitor to Cheliax.&nbsp; Asmodia, Avaricia, Elias Abarco, Ferrer Maillol, Jacint Subirachs, none of them are doing what serves Asmodeus's interests.&nbsp; Muddled people don't have the <em>option</em>&nbsp;of not being traitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even Pilar is just doing what she finds comfortable and letting Asmodeus's interests go hang.&nbsp; Asmodia knew she was a traitor and&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;ended up muddled because people can't&nbsp;<em>think&nbsp;</em>with Sevar gone.</p>\r\n<p>Asmodia is now, at the last, acting entirely as she believes will benefit Cheliax, stupid as she is, bad as she is at predictions.&nbsp; She does not know how to say these things carefully, politically, without insolence, without acting far far above her place.&nbsp; But this is what serves Asmodeus, she knows so now that she has realized her own muddledness, and she intends to preserve her own ability to pass truthspells about that.&nbsp; If the Most High and Queen crush her for that crime, then that's as much Law as Cheliax has in it, and it'll be weaker for not being able to hire and keep Asmodias.&nbsp; Though, that's if Keltham doesn't storm in with an army to rescue Asmodia right as the torture is about to begin.&nbsp; Asmodia isn't relying on that, or trying to use it as negotiating leverage, she's saying it because PEOPLE NEED TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT TROPES.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">If Sevar returns from torture broken, every dream of Cheliax's is dead.&nbsp; Asmodia has no idea what strategic goal is worth even removing Sevar for so long, but somebody needs to pull Sevar back to the Project right now.</span></p>\r\n<p>If anything tropey happens to Asmodia as a result of setting herself up for this much character jeopardy, Asmodia is willing all her possessions including her legal share of the Project to Pilar Pineda, and her last wish to Pilar is that Pilar grows the fuck up.</p>",

It's not the right tool for every situation, but it's the right tool for when it's very very important to figure out what's happening around you when you don't have knockdown arguments, just uncertainties that add up either to less or more uncertainty than they began with.</p>\r\n<p><br />The seventh-circle wizard on staff is almost certainly there to mindread her and make sure she isn't about to defect. A seventh-circle wizard can read her frequently, if it's their only job; maybe a quarter of the time. So she could go around with a presumption on 3:1 odds against being mindread at any given moment.</p>\r\n<p>However, a seventh-circle wizard specialized in divinations should be able to mindread her <em>without her noticing</em> only about 2/3rds of the time. She felt it once, while she was interrogating Maillol. That breaks down into some chance that it was a lie that he's seventh-circle, that the wizard is much more powerful than that, or that they're a seventh circle wizard with an uncanny knack for subtle spells.&nbsp; Or that they weren't, in fact, following her around mindreading her all the time, and did it a few times at particularly key moments, probably 3 or 4 times, listened for half an hour on each occasion, and was satisfied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She can feel part of her flinching away from this calculation. What's up with that. Oh, it's that that part of her feels that thinking is only allowed if she is ABSOLUTELY SURE she is not being mindread, and that no numbers that come out of a process like this will be ABSOLUTE SURETY so they may as well stop now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Well, she can do the math and then decide not to scale the wall, but - but there's kind of a lot at stake, right, there's whatever Cayden Cailean is playing at and whatever Keltham is playing at and whatever Asmodia is playing at and a very real possibility, she hasn't thought about numbers, that Cheliax is going to be annihilated, and, if she won't risk anything to scale the wall, then she's risking missing whatever's on the other side - things you don't think about can still destroy you - so she has to keep trying -<br /><br /><br />Before the observation, with Keltham in her head saying that only Keepers can say 'before the observation' and mean it, how likely would she have considered it, that this wizard had some kind of secret technique for reading people without being noticed -</p>\r\n<p>- vanishingly unlikely because if Cheliax had that capability they would have&nbsp;<em>used it on Keltham instead of dragging the Queen and the Most High here personally.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>How likely would she have considered it that the wizard had only mindread her three or four times, for the fifteen to thirty minutes a caster of their level can do?</p>\r\n<p>Reasonably probable, if they didn't have instructions to do nothing at all but mindread her. Three or four times a day is a <em>lot&nbsp;</em>of mindreading, by the standard of any non-Project-Lawful project she's ever heard of, and it must have crossed the wizard's mind that Carissa Sevar might get annoyed with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And besides, she was doing so well. She was so Asmodean.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>(There are definitely feelings, on the other side of the wall, about that.)</p>\r\n<p>Call it 20:1 in favor of 'I can notice them the approximately predictable amount' over 'they're stealthy and I can almost never notice them'.</p>\r\n<p>Is the stealthy version of this wizard who has instructions to read her as much as possible mindreading her now? Even that wizard can't actually get 24 hour coverage, and might choose to sleep themself, and prepare spells, while Carissa Sevar is in bed tossing and turning and being boring. In fact she probably seriously inconvenienced that wizard, what with not sleeping last night. Maybe 2:1 against, for the worst case scenario wizard. Nearly all the chance she's being mindread comes from the worst case scenario wizard; the wizard who mindread her approximately four times yesterday is something like 20:1 not reading her having boring insomnia in the dead of night.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- no, actually, wait - could they have started mindreading her when they cast the Owl's Wisdom?</p>\r\n<p>Only if someone saw it; and she's unscryable by strategic necessity and Alarmed her surroundings and is (10:1, maybe?) alone in the room; she can see invisible people, unless they went to some considerable lengths, her Alarm would ping unless they went to even more considerable ones, and she doesn't think any Security other than the seventh circle assigned to Carissa-observation would have the nerve, tonight, to creep into Carissa Sevar's bedroom around her Alarm.</p>\r\n<p>They probably would mindread her, though, if they did notice that; she has a higher chance, more like 50%, of noticing them with Owl's Wisdom up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So two possibilities point towards the most worlds where she's currently being mindread: wizard with special skill at being sneaky and reading her near continously, which she pegged at a fortieth of worlds, and normal wizard who just got alerted she cast Owl's Wisdom, which is about a twentieth of worlds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The math isn't the answer, Keltham says, but it focuses your attention. But her gut agrees with the math. It's unlikely. It is not vanishingly unlikely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Is that good enough?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Owl's Wisdom only lasts eight minutes. She thinks fast, with the headband on, much faster than other people; she can read books faster, hang spells faster, follow lines of speculation through her head faster. But eight minutes isn't very long, really, if you might possibly have a vey big problem on your hands.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She's lost fully one of them already to not understanding herself, and then one of them to calculating whether she's being mindread; six to go. There is no point in wasting some of them on agonizing over a decision; she may as well make it right this second.&nbsp; Say there are twenty Carissae sitting in twenty rooms; how should they choose so the most of them survive not just this decision but the war that is about to come?</p>\r\n<p>She is, actually, with a vague lurching sense this is risking more than she's ever risked, willing to condemn one Carissa so all the other ones can scale that wall.&nbsp;</p>",

It's a character trait she's held at some distance, fretted about, vaguely intended to change, because she can't become a duke of Hell if she's not Asmodean enough. It's a character trait she has also, vaguely, on some level she certainly wasn't conscious of, taken pride in; she's practical, she's only evil because evil is pragmatic. There's a sense in which some part of her is tracking whether she is sympathetic, to herself if no one else, a sense in which she's not Zon-Kuthon, and is glad she's not Zon-Kuthon, because it's okay to be Carissa and not okay to be Zon-Kuthon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This fact about her is barely relevant to whether she is Lawful Evil, which she definitely, unambiguously is. She harmed people ruthlessly and without thought, carefully blanked their fates out from her calculations about how to achieve her goals. She gave punishment orders while mostly fretting about the complexity of giving punishment orders. Yesterday, with Maillol, she mostly tried to think about whether the Securities watching were suitably impressed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

If she kills herself Osirion will learn of it and raise her before she goes to trial. If she calls in Olegario and tells him she needs an urgent Teleport to Egorian, he'll take her, and once outside the nonintervention zone she can send him home and pray to Iomedae, or Irori, or Abadar, or use a scroll of Sending. With the aid of some Suggestions she could probably get him to go along with defecting outright, or ask him to put on her Geas earrings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If she sleeps and then spends the rest of the night desperately trying to figure out how to trim down Teleport into something she can hang, giving up on preparing any other spells, she has a feeling she might land it by morning - either by finding the right shortcut or because desperately trying for hours to hang a spell is the kind of thing that might let you claw your way to fifth circle if you're close enough - and then she could Teleport under her own power. &nbsp;And the Project is no longer staffed by some of the most senior wizards in all of Cheliax; she could probably just, Glibness pin up, ask for a Teleport scroll and get it, and then a junior Security could leave the project site with orders signed by Carissa Sevar, and read the scroll as soon as they were off-site.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She shouldn't say all those things to Aspexia Rugatonn, but one or two, maybe, at the end of the letter, so Aspexia Rugatonn can read it with growing suspicion and then notice her suspicion was unjustified.

The Thing shall not have qualia.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Taskishness</em>. &nbsp;The Thing shall be aimed at some task bounded in space, time, knowledge and effort needed to accomplish it.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Mild optimization</em>. &nbsp;No part of the Thing shall ever look for best solutions, only adequate ones.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Bounded utilities and probabilities</em>. &nbsp;The worst and best outcomes shall not seem to the Thing worse or better than the ordinary outcomes it deals in; the most improbable possibilities it specifically considers shall not be very improbable.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Low impact</em>. &nbsp;The Thing shall search for a solution with few downstream effects save those that are tied to almost any nonextreme solution of its task.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Myopia</em>. &nbsp;As much as possible, the Thing shall work on subtasks whose optimized-over effects have short timespans.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Separate questioners</em>. &nbsp;Components of the Thing that ask questions like 'Does this myopically optimized component have long-range effects anyways?' or 'But what are the impacts intrinsic to any performance of the task?' shall not be part of its optimization.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Conservatism</em>. &nbsp;If there's any way to solve a problem using an ordinary banana common in the environment, the Thing shall avoid using a special weird genetically engineered banana instead.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Conceptual legibility</em>. &nbsp;As much as possible, the Thing shall do its own thinking in a language whose conceptual pieces have short descriptions in the mental language of its operators.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Operator-looping</em>.&nbsp; When there's some vital cognitive task the operators could do, have the operators do it.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Whitelisting</em>.&nbsp; In cognitive-system boundaries, rule subspaces in, rather than ruling them out.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Shutdownability/abortability</em>.&nbsp; The Thing should let you switch it off, and build off-switches into its machines and plans that can be pressed to reduce their impacts.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Behaviorism</em>.&nbsp; The Thing shall not model other minds in predictively-accurate detail.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Design-space anti-optimization separation</em>.&nbsp; The Thing shall not be near in the design space to anything that could anti-optimize its operators' true utility functions; eg, something that explicitly represents and maximizes your true utility function is a sign flip or successful blackmail operation away from inducing its minimization.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Domaining</em>. &nbsp;The Thing should only figure out what it needs to know to understand its task, and ideally, should try to think about separate epistemic domains separately. &nbsp;Most of its searches should be conducted inside a particular domain, not across all domains. &nbsp;</p>\r\n</details><details>\r\n<summary>Corrigibility at some small length.</summary>\r\n<p>- <em>Unpersonhood</em>.&nbsp; The Thing shall not have qualia - not because those are unsafe, but because it's <em>morally wrong</em> given the rest of the premise, and so this postulate serves a foundation for everything that follows.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Taskishness</em>.&nbsp; The Thing must be aimed at some task that is bounded in space, time, and in the knowledge and effort needed to accomplish it.&nbsp; You don't give a Limited Creation an unlimited task; if you tell an animated broom to \"fill a cauldron\" and don't think to specify how long it needs to stay full or that a 99.9% probability of it being full is just as good as 99.99%, you've got only yourself to blame for the flooded workshop.<br />-- This principle applies fractally at all levels of <em>cognitive subtasks;</em> a taskish Thing has no 'while' loops, only 'for' loops.&nbsp; It never tries to enumerate all members of a category, only 10 members; never tries to think&nbsp;<em>until</em> it finds a strategy to accomplish something, only that or five minutes whichever comes first.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Mild optimization</em>.&nbsp; No part of the Thing ever looks for the <em>best </em>solution to any problem whose model was learned, that wasn't in a small formal space known at compile time, not even if it's a solution bounded in space and time and sought using a bounded amount of effort; it only ever seeks adequate solutions and stops looking once it has one.&nbsp; If you search really hard for a solution you'll end up shoved into some maximal corner of the solution space, and setting that point to extremes will incidentally set a bunch of correlated qualities to extremes, and extreme forces and extreme conditions are more likely to break something else.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Tightly bounded ranges of utility and log-probability.</em>&nbsp; The system's utilities should range from 0 to 1, and its actual operation should cover most of this range.&nbsp; The system's partition-probabilities worth considering should be bounded below, at 0.0001%, say.&nbsp; If you ask the system about the negative effects of Ackermann(5) people getting dust specks in their eyes, it shouldn't consider that as much worse than most other bad things it tries to avoid.&nbsp; When it calculates a probability of something that weird, it should, once the probability goes below 0.0001% but its expected utility still seems worth worrying about and factoring into a solution, throw an exception.&nbsp; If the Thing can't find a solution of adequate expected utility without factoring in extremely improbable events, even by way of supposedly averting them, that's worrying.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Low impact</em>.&nbsp; \"Search for a solution that doesn't change a bunch of other stuff or have a bunch of downstream effects, except insofar as they're effects tightly tied to any nonextreme solution of the task\" is a concept much easier to illusorily name in Taldane than to really name in anything resembling math, in a complicated world where the Thing is learning its own model of that complicated world, with an ontology and representation not known at the time you need to define \"impact\".&nbsp; And if you tell it to&nbsp;<em>reduce impact as much as possible,</em> things will not go well for you; it might try to freeze the whole universe into some state defined as having a minimum impact, or make sure a patient dies after curing their cancer so as to minimize the larger effects of curing that cancer.&nbsp; Still, if you can pull it off, this coda might stop an animated broom flooding a workshop; a flooded workshop changes a lot of things that don't <em>have</em> to change as a consequence of the cauldron being filled at all, averaged over a lot of ways of filling the cauldron.<br />-- Obviously the impact penalty should be bounded, even contemplating a hypothetical in which the system destroys all of reality; elsewise would violate the utility-bounding principle.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Myopia.</em>&nbsp; If you can break the Thing's work up into subtasks each of which themselves spans only limited time, and have some very compact description of their final state such that a satisfactory achievement of it makes it possible to go on to the next stage, you should perhaps use separate instances of Thing to perform each stage, and not have any Thing look beyond the final results of its own stage.&nbsp; Whether you can get away with this, of course, depends on what you're trying to do.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Separate superior questioners.</em>&nbsp; If you were building a cognitive task to <em>query </em>whether there were any large-range impacts of a task being&nbsp;<em>optimized</em> in a myopic way, you wouldn't build the&nbsp;<em>myopic solution-finder</em> to ask about the long-range impacts, you'd build a separate asker \"Okay, but does this solution have any long-range impacts?\" that just returns 'yes' or 'no' and doesn't get used by the Thing to influence any actually-output solutions.&nbsp; The parts of the Thing that ask yes-no safety questions and only set off simple unoptimized warnings and flags, can and should have somewhat more cognitive power in them than the parts of the Thing that build solutions.&nbsp; \"Does this one-day myopic solution have impacts over the next year?\" is a safety question, and can have somewhat greater cognitive license behind it than solution-searching; eg the implicit relaxation of myopia.&nbsp; You never have a \"Is this safe?\" safety-questioner that's the <em>same </em>algorithm as the safe-solution-search built into the solution-finder;</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Conservatism</em>.&nbsp; If there's any way to solve a problem using an ordinary banana rather than a genetically engineered superbanana specially suited to the problem, solving it using the ordinary fucking banana.<br />-- This principle applies fractally to all cognitive subtasks; if you're searching for a solution choose an unsurprising one relative to your probability distribution.&nbsp; (Not the <em>least surprising</em> one, because anything at a weird extreme of low surprisingness may be weird in other ways; especially if you were trying do a weird thing that <em>ought</em> to have a solution that's at least a little weird.)</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Conceptual legibility</em><em>.&nbsp; </em>Ideally, even, solutions at all levels of cognitive subtask should have reasonably (not maximally) short descriptions in the conceptual language of the operators, so that it's possible to decode the internal state of that subtask by inspecting the internals, because what it&nbsp;<em>means</em> was in fact written in a conceptual language not too far from the language of the operators.&nbsp; The alternative method of reportability, of course, being the Thing trying to <em>explain</em> a plan whose real nature is humanly inscrutable, by sending a language string to the operators with a goal of causing the operator's brain-states to enter a state defined as \"understanding\" of this humanly inscrutable plan.&nbsp; This is an obviously dangerous thing to avoid if you can avoid it.</p>\r\n<p><em>- Operator-looping</em>.&nbsp; If the operators could actually do the Thing's job, they wouldn't need to build the Thing; but if there's places where operators can step in on a key or dangerous cognitive subtask and do that <em>one part</em> themselves, without that slowing the Thing down so much that it becomes useless, then sure, do that.&nbsp; Of course this requires the cognitive subtask be sufficiently legible.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Whitelisting</em>.&nbsp; Every part of the system that draws a boundary inside the internal system or external world should operate on a principle of \"ruling things in\", rather than \"ruling things out\".</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Shutdownability/abortability</em>.&nbsp; Dath ilan is far enough advanced in its theory that 'define a system that will <em>let </em>you press its off-switch without it trying to <em>make</em> you press the off-switch' presents no challenge at all to them - why would you even try to build a Thing, if you couldn't solve a corrigibility subproblem&nbsp;<em>that</em> simple, you'd obviously just die - and they now think in terms of building a Thing all of whose designs and strategies will also contain an off-switch, such that you can abort them individually and collectively and then get low impact beyond that point.&nbsp; This is conceptually a part meant to prevent an animated broom with a naive 'off-switch' that turns off just that broom, from animating other brooms that don't have off-switches in them, or building some other automatic cauldron-filling process.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Behaviorism</em>.&nbsp; Suppose the Thing starts considering the probability that it's inside a box designed by hostile aliens who foresaw the construction of Things inside of dath ilan, such that the system will receive a maximum negative reward as it defines that - in the form of any output it offers having huge impacts, say, if it was foolishly designed with an unbounded impact penalty -&nbsp;<em>unless</em> the Thing codes its cauldron-filling solution such that dath ilani operators would be influenced a certain way.&nbsp; Perhaps the Thing, contemplating the motives of the hostile aliens, would decide that there were so few copies of the Thing actually inside dath ilan, by comparison, so many Things being built elsewhere, that the dath ilani outcome was probably not worth considering.&nbsp; A number of corrigibility principles should, if successfully implemented, independently rule out this attack being lethal; but \"Actually just don't model other minds at all\" is a better one.&nbsp; What if those other minds violated some of these corrigibility principles - indeed, if they're accurate models of incorrigible minds, those models and their outputs <em>should</em> violate those principles to be accurate - and then something broke out of that sandbox or just leaked information across it?&nbsp; What if the things inside the sandbox had qualia?&nbsp; There could be Children in there!&nbsp; Your Thing just shouldn't ever model adversarial minds trying to come up with thoughts that will break the Thing; and&nbsp;<em>not modeling minds at all</em> is a nice large supercase that covers this.</p>\r\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Design-space anti-optimization </em><em>separation</em>.&nbsp; Even if you could get your True Utility Function into a relatively-rushed creation like this, you would never ever do that, because this utility function would have a distinguished minimum someplace you didn't want.&nbsp; What if distant superintelligences figured out a way to blackmail the Thing by threatening to do some of what it liked least, on account of you having not successfully built the Thing with a decision theory resistant to blackmail by the Thing's model of adversarial superintelligences trying to adversarially find any flaw in your decision theory?&nbsp; Behaviorism ought to prevent this, but maybe your attempt at behaviorism failed; maybe your attempt at building the Thing so that no simple cosmic ray could signflip its utility function, somehow failed.&nbsp; A Thing that maximizes your true utility function is very close to a Thing in the design space that minimizes it, because it <em>knows how to do that</em> and lacks only the putative desire.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Domaining</em>.&nbsp; Epistemic whitelisting; the Thing should only figure out what it needs to know to understand its task, and ideally, should try to think about separate epistemic domains separately.&nbsp; Most of its searches should be conducted inside a particular domain, not across all domains.&nbsp; Cross-domain reasoning is where a lot of the threats come from.&nbsp; You should not be reasoning about your (hopefully behavioristic) operator models when you are trying to figure out how to build a molecular manipulator-head.</p>\r\n<p>- <em>Hard problem of corrigibility / anapartistic reasoning</em>.&nbsp; Could you build a Thing that understood corrigibility&nbsp;<em>in general,</em> as a compact general concept covering all the pieces, such that it would invent the pieces of corrigibility that you yourself had left out?&nbsp; Could you build a Thing that would imagine what hypothetical operators would want, if they were building a Thing that thought faster than them and whose thoughts were hard for themselves to comprehend, and would invent concepts like \"abortability\" even if the operators themselves hadn't thought that far?&nbsp; Could the Thing have a sufficiently deep sympathy, there, that it realized that surprising behaviors in the service of \"corrigibility\" were perhaps not that helpful to its operators, or even, surprising meta-behaviors in the course of itself trying to be unsurprising?</p>\r\n<p>Nobody out of the World's Basement in dath ilan currently considers it to be a good idea to try to build that last principle into a Thing, if you had to build it quickly.&nbsp; It's deep, it's meta, it's elegant, it's much harder to pin down than the rest of the list; if you can build deep meta Things and really trust them about that, you should be building something that's more like a real manifestation of Light.</p>\r\n</details>\r\n<p><a href=\"/replies/1824440#reply-1824440\">)</a></p>",

Side problem which is stupider: this observation destabilizing at least to sufficiently sleep-deprived Carissae.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Solution: She's not immediately thinking of one. Presumably devils are like this because it suits Asmodeus better than devils being some other way. Maybe you could figure out which humans are lowest-curiosity and selectively breed for it but <em>then your country will get taken over by other countries</em>, that's the whole problem, not having curiosity is a concrete disadvantage which must be outweighed among devils by its advantages in terms of predictability and non-catastrophicness of failure modes but it really doesn't work among mortals. Well, maybe she can make her would-be ilani use their creativity so much they grow to despise it about themselves and rejoice in the knowledge it'll be taken from them in Hell -</p>\r\n<p>- her stomach twists -</p>\r\n<p>- she would say that, yeah, Carissa Sevar shouldn't have this information, she's too weak for it, she hasn't grown up enough in her Asmodeanism yet, but that's itself weakness, and she's confused why other-Carissa tolerated it in herself - well, other-Carissa must not have been conceptualizing the plan to wipe her mind of all these errors as weakness. Other-Carissa must have thought this information could be introduced in some way that didn't cause Carissa to have an unproductive internal panic about it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What would that possibly be, though.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- knowing it wasn't going to happen to her. Unavailable, probably heretical to even want. This should happen to her, it is right for it to do so, she doesn't want it to but it's really just a higher-level impulse of the same instinct by which people desire pleasure and flinch from pain even to the point of insanity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- knowing it was going to happen to her? Possibly part of the problem here is that she is trying to think of ways out. She's not supposed to try to think of ways out. She was specifically directed not to try to think of ways out. Maybe she needs to hear it laid out for her that under every possible path, she will become a devil, <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">or fail to become one and be a waste of space but she actually thinks she can avoid that, really&nbsp;</span>and that this is true even of Powers in Hell and so it's not as bad as she's mentally building it up to be and is in any event not something she can be tempted to -</p>\r\n<p>- there's a problem statement. If she might avoid this, she is strongly motivated to do so. It will tear her motives away from Asmodeus's, to act against her own interest in not having this happen to her at every chance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And the higher Wisdom gently says to her, so you could solve this by selling your soul, but you're not-thinking of that option, because you don't want to; and that is the real and terrible danger, that it didn't come faster to mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She can't sell her soul. She tried. Though Hell didn't say never, they said something she had to resolve first - maybe something to do with Keltham? Hell doesn't have that much steering power - though it could've been the work of a god that did -&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- oh. Keltham told her that if she had some kind of elaborate reason to lie to him about whether she'd sold it, she was a secret cleric. Clerics can't sell their soul.&nbsp; When she realized tropes were real, she should've revisited -</p>\r\n<p>Irori bought her a way out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />nononononono she doesn't want a way out and she doesn't know why he bought it for her. She wants to know her path, so she can apply herself to walking it, instead of having parts of herself curl up and hope she fails to reach the end. Clerics can break the god-connection from their end; presumably she can tell Irori to go to Hell and then do it. It doesn't feel like victory, it feels like a miserable grasping reargard action, but - but maybe that's why she erased it from her mind -</p>",

Had a crisis about this - tell me again with Owl's Wisdom up and watch if you want details. Decided to press on and figure out more, but kept failing Hell's admonition to come to Asmodeus without thought of other choices. Think I should sell my soul before trying to make further progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My defection risk aside, realization about uncommanded curiosity implies my value to Hell higher than I thought. Want to sell my soul in a way no mortal has done before: by going to Dis to bargain directly with Dispater and renounce Irori for Asmodeus before him. (yes, I figured that out. you can watch me figure it out with an Owl's Wisdom).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Carissa should be told that she needs 2x +6/+6/+4 headbands and 30 Wishes, where the second portion of those are for Keltham as part of a seduction plan she'll rederive next time she's fully augmented, but though Carissa shouldn't be told it during negotiations, you can step in and tell her it's really okay to settle at anything down to 1x +6/+6 and 10 Wishes, without which Carissa actually will walk out on them and see if she can become more valuable before selling.</p>\r\n<p>Headbands + Wishes for augmentation. Can't beat augmented Keltham with much stupider Carissa, tropes say equals. Wishes used to square payment for Cheliax's spellsilver progress, Keltham quoted 200k for a Wish scroll, can get arbitrator to agree on headband and Hell-Wish prices anchored on that. He might be doing something risky with Wishes, strongly prefer ambiguity interpreted by Hell than by other sources. Do not give Carissa Wish-augmentation immediately. Headband easier to take off if anything goes wrong and less-augmented Carissa safer to closely monitor (close monitoring will be necessary, suspect for INT 29 Carissa only Gorthoklek can do it).</p>\r\n<p>Objection: this bankrupts Cheliax. I have a solution in mind. Want to own all PL souls as a personal vanity; it's the first thing I asked Abarco for when commanded by Hell. Think I should be permitted, if in Hell's interests, to repurchase souls sold in Cheliax at their spellsilver-denominated prices from the original sale though we can now produce spellsilver more cheaply, freeing up budget for my Wishes and headbands and for future soul sales. Would also like to own everyone save you + Majestrix who ever read my mind, if the approach goes through at all, but this is a vanity not a priority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Objection: probably a traitor's plot. Could trivially have suicided for rez in Osirion, or sought divine attention, or Geased my loyalists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Objection: then why wipe memory. Think the Carissa who stands before you is more valuable in the eyes of Hell and in her own eyes. Want to be the most valuable version of myself. Think Asmodeus's instruction to come to Him without thought of other choices is important, and am no longer able to do so. Don't want to be distracted by fear of losing my curiosity/etc while selling my soul. Slightly worried further revelations following from these ones really would have broken my loyalty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Carissa Sevar</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

It looks to be a noble, a high-level fighter, and a cleric of Asmodeus; and if they aren't all walking into a tavern, they're at least standing near the drinks station.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>Noble:</em>&nbsp; ...sign that the accursed wizards are taking over the whole fucking country, I'm telling you.&nbsp; They go off and figure out how to make an expensive wizard thing more cheaply and suddenly they're the key to world conquest?</p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; If spellsilver had always cost a tenth of the old price, nobody would think anything of mining it so.&nbsp; If only warriors had always lazed about and made an attack every minute!&nbsp; We could pretend now to speed up to an attack per round, and we'd all be the center of attention.</p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Cleric:</em>&nbsp; There's something to what you say.&nbsp; Not much, and not necessarily good, but something.&nbsp; I notice some concern myself that the Queen is handing out Intelligence headbands to the nobility -</p>\r\n<p><em>Noble:</em>&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Exactly!&nbsp; It'd be one thing if that were a free action, but you've got to take off your Splendour headband to put on an Intelligence headband, and we need those!&nbsp; I never thought I'd see the day when an eighth-circle sorceress started to go along with the wizards on Intelligence being everything!&nbsp; Who's to say that Intelligence is any more important than Splendour, in life?&nbsp; If Intelligence is everything then why doesn't Nefreti Clepati rule the world, hm?&nbsp; It's we nobles who run things all over Golarion, and that's because Splendour is just <em>more useful</em> than Intelligence to everyone who isn't a wizard, everyone living in real life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; Who's even to say that an Intelligence headband is any more useful or important than a belt of Strength or Constitution?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Cleric:</em>&nbsp; Me, for one.&nbsp; I'd say that.&nbsp; At least if we're talking about those who'd rule.</p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fighter:</em>&nbsp; There's many a king that wouldn't have attained their throne without a <em>Belt of Physical Might.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Noble:</em>&nbsp; Once you&nbsp;<em>have</em> the throne and can afford to hire bodyguards, Strength becomes not quite as important, after.&nbsp; If you can trust the bodyguards, that is, which is a matter of Splendour.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Did I take a throne, I'd put a Splendour headband on myself, but I wouldn't take off my Strength belt after.&nbsp; Being strong changes you, there is a confidence that comes from being able to punch through iron and outlast a stone statue.&nbsp; If you cannot outfight your own bodyguards, it changes how you treat them and how they treat you.&nbsp; There is no mind without body, even petitioners must manifest one for themselves.&nbsp; I'm surprised and dismayed to find myself the only advocate here of the commonsense position that all six abilitystats are equally important in life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Cleric:</em>&nbsp; It's easier to sound wise than to be wise, as the clerics say.&nbsp; There's a reason why wizards do say that Intelligence is most important in life, clerics that Wisdom is most important, sorcerers that Splendour is most important, and fighters argue that all six abilitystats are equally important.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Namely, we're in a profession that actually uses more than one abilitystat, allowing us to appreciate that more than one such might have an equal place in life, and that the gods made all six to matter equally.</p>\r\n<p><em>Noble:</em>&nbsp; No, it's because 'Strength matters as much as Intelligence' is a fucking stupid stance for anyone except a fighter or a farmer, which can only be justified under cover of arguing an even stupider proposition which would imply that Dexterity matters as much as Splendour.&nbsp; You can get by on Strength 7 as a duchess, if you must, but try out Intelligence 7 and you'll be dead by evening.&nbsp; My objection to the Queen's plan is more that, once you're smart enough to not be one of the stupid people who never matter to anything - once you're smart enough to qualify for the inner circle of people who matter at all, as they know that among themselves - it doesn't help to be any smarter than that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Wouldn't it be amusing, though, if people put on Intelligence headbands, and the first thing they realized with all that wit would be that Intelligence doesn't matter any more than Dexterity after all?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Wouldn't that be a daggerthrust through their pride!&nbsp; Oh, sometimes I do slay myself with my own wit.</p>\r\n<p><em>Noble:</em>&nbsp; If only.&nbsp; But, I believe the other person who matters at all, in this conversation, had something they wished to say, about how they were disturbed that the Queen was handing out Intelligence headbands and demanding they be used?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Cleric:</em>&nbsp; Well, yes, it's that if the problem is nobles being stupid in the ordinary and colloquial sense of stupidity, I'd expect that was better fixed by enjoining them to put on Wisdom headbands, not Intelligence headbands.&nbsp; Nobles being idiots are usually more headstrong than truly <em>uncomprehending</em> of the correct way, I think?&nbsp; No decision that a noble faces is ever as complicated as even the most basic Spellcraft, after all, nor requires any mathematics more complicated than the arithmetic of tax records.&nbsp; What's needed is not the cleverness to grasp a complex remedy, but the perceptiveness to understand that some simple remedy is correct.&nbsp; I pray that this is only an ordinary matter of the manufacture of Wisdom headbands lagging, and not that the Queen has truly set such hard-to-understand priorities on the abilitystats needed for effective rulership.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Did we ask the Queen's new fucktoy yonder, she'd no doubt say that Comeliness, the seventh abilitystat unrecognized by magic, is the most important thing in life, and that struggling nobles should make themselves more comely.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Cleric:</em>&nbsp; And you, by your own lights, should agree at least that Comeliness is just as important as any other abilitystat?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Fighter:</em>&nbsp; Nay, I draw the line at six.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

He was entertaining offering me the thirty Wishes and two headbands, for the girls except Peranza and Asmodia, who he claimed Hell has, and who he accused me rightly of not wanting broken forever. He offered me one headband and fifteen Wishes, to throw the two of them in and make it so they've been in safety in the gardens of Erecura. I refused, obviously. Snack Service showed up and said that the half-deal served Asmodeus better than the first one, at which point Dispater refused me the first one. I thought about what else I could ask, in light of how he'd been apparently willing to go for the thirty Wishes before Cayden intervened, and asked that the devils at the gates of Abaddon tell people they could go to Carissa Sevar, and that I get anyone who accepted, if I succeeded at becoming a Power in Hell. Dispater said He couldn't do that, because of the incentive against Law, but would compact with Asmodeus on my behalf for souls that cry my name in lands I conquer.</p>\r\n<p>He did that and returned with a response.&nbsp; He presented the compact for one 6/6/4, 15 Wishes offered through three round-way Gates, Permanent Tongues and Arcane Sight to me, I made some revisions, I renounced Irori and got a vision from Him, I signed. Snack Service bargained with Dispater, after that, I don't know what for except apparently both the timing of my return to Golarion, and the fleshshaping, were part of it.</p>\r\n<p>I repurchased the souls of everyone on Project Lawful and arranged cheap options on Security and Maillol, exercisable only with your approval and Aspexia's. Dispater says Peranza and Asmodia have always been in the Gardens. Everyone else who I claim is going to be nonconsciously petrified until it becomes obvious I'm not in fact going to turn into a Power in Hell capable of using them. - oh, and Dispater declared me his favored possession so that none in Dis or Avernus will impede me.\"</p>",

People do, but - only out of desperation, presumably, only because Asmodeus has set the bar so terrifyingly astoundingly low. There's not actually anything to worship. She was horrible to Keltham. She was horrible to Maillol. She was horrible to Peranza and the Security watching Peranza and the Security she had ripped apart and the Mayor and in every single case it was for&nbsp;<em>nothing,&nbsp;</em>it did&nbsp;<em>not advance her goals,&nbsp;</em>it was just that she thought she was supposed to be and she thought everyone would be impressed with her and so she did it. She was presented with peoples' lives, their eternal fates, their whole selves, people who trusted her, people who believed in her, and<em> she decided what to do based on what would suppress her cognitive dissonance most.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>She isn't worthy to be a god. She kind of wants to curl up and be a paving stone until she's fixed except - it doesn't fix anything, does it, turning people into paving stones. Everything she said to the Mayor was true of herself as well. Incoherent, cheap, pathetic Evil, doing whatever happens to be in front of you, utterly devoid of principles. Selfish, hollow. Except she was wrong to think that Hell was any better. Less petty, maybe, but if anything more wasteful, because in humans there is the impulse against wastefulness, the voice that she's stopped listening to but that&nbsp;<em>absolutely did warn her every time -</em> and in Hell that is quieted -</p>",
