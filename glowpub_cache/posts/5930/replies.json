Outside of complicated hypotheticals about Zon-Kuthon nope that too is getting too caught up in her head -</p>\r\n<p>Carissa Sevar needs to figure out all that stuff, at some point, so that this whole complex juggling act doesn't come crashing down on her head and destroy everything she loves. Keltham's possession does not need to figure out all that stuff. She just needs to stop thinking and let things happen to her until Keltham gets what he wants, or gets bored.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A lot of things hurt a lot less, if you stop thinking about them. It might not be very dath ilani, but it's true.</p>\r\n<p>Love is a lot nicer when you stop thinking about it. That, she suspects, is a perfectly Asmodean stance to have on it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Keltham's possession can relax around him, because it wouldn't matter if she tried to be on her guard or not. Keltham's possession cannot protect herself and cannot advance her goals and cannot talk but can, through small happy sounds, convey that that's quite all right, really, and that she does not want it to end.</p>",

Should I put it in a dath ilani kind of way? Some Peranzas are stuck in a world where Iomedae's a poser, and her countries are at their limits holding onto the Worldwound and could spare no one for a war with Cheliax even if they thought it was as urgent as that, and could spare only a few units if they thought it was more important than that. And where Abadar is down to negotiate with us so Osirion won't stand in our way, or where they try and we flatten them. Cheliax is making spellsilver much much cheaper than anyone else, as you kindly tried to tell Iomedae, though it doesn't look like it worked. The headband assembly line is, what, a few weeks from working, and then Sevar can do the same thing for items with military applications.</p>\r\n<p>And those are the things I happen to know about from following the reject whores who signed up for special Keeper training; I don't think they're all the real Project has going.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Some Peranzas - most Peranzas, I'd argue, but let's go with 'some Peranzas' - live in a world where Hell's going to win, and they're going to spend the rest of eternity paying for that one try at letting Good know what's coming. And you have no idea how Cheliax and Osirion stack up militarily, or how many soldiers Iomedae commands, or whether the secret thing that made the war with Nidal go so fast for us will be replicated, so there's no way you sized up some facts you knew and decided you were on the winning side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I don't know why you did it, but that's not why.\"</p>",

It seems entirely plausible that this is the whole of Cailean's plan, what He was purchasing with everything else; that the girls would believe, correctly or at least with justification, that Cailean would intervene on their behalf, that they'd recklessly betray Cheliax on that assumption, remembering Tonia finding herself outside the fortress, believing that could be them.</p>\r\n<p><br />The greatest threat to the project at this time, in his view, is defection. If they can hold onto the girls, they can win everything; if they can't, it will all come crashing down. It does not seem worth it to him to make any concession that makes it easier for the girls to believe Cailean would help them. In fact, if Pilar returns to the fortress un-cursed, and everyone learns that the Project at last broke with Cayden Cailean over whether Peranza should be tortured to death, that seems good for Asmodeus, so good for Asmodeus that it's hard to imagine some benefit of not torturing Peranza beats it.

Evil gods which like the world some other flavor of Evil; Good gods who would be making worse trades, operating farther from their own areas of strength, if they acted to directly oppose Asmodeus. Mortals have an instinct for this even when no gods guide them, and you see it at the scale of countries, in a place like Avistan: they will set aside their other enmities in the face of a greater threat, compromise on things they hate to compromise on, mobilize resources they'd preferred to have in reserve.</p>\r\n<p>And so it is the case that a drastic strengthening of the position of Asmodeus, and of Cheliax, does not mean that Cheliax conquers all of Golarion, and does not mean that Hell conquers all, nor even does it mean that Iomedae despairs of this universe and joins that fragment of Nethys trying to destroy it.&nbsp; It means that, as a worst-case scenario against which Iomedae can compare Her better options, that She can call a convocation of the gods to re-counterbalance against Asmodeus, to check Him at their own expense. It means that Sarenrae, whose power goes farthest extended to mortals busy in the assistance of one another, donates power to soldiers instead. There'd be fewer miracles, and more funerals. More orphans would starve on the streets, more sick people would die in pain and alone. But the legions of Good could swell to meet Evil's new power.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It means that Erastil, who operates these days almost entirely by rote, to save his power for his works, answering instinctively the prayers of farmers with blighted crops, agrees to instead allow Chelish ones to starve, agree to allow their prayers to go unanswered so their grain cannot feed Chelish armies. Humans care about many, many things, and Good in its many forms answers nearly all of them; but it could trade that away, at need. (Iomedae, Herself, would be trading away much more of that already, for the sake of defeating Evil, even at the unfavorable ratios that the other Good gods could get; but She is not all of human values, and is in fact a segment of them which intends to render itself unnecessary.)</p>\r\n<p>And then there are agreements that could be made with non-Good powers that aren't Asmodeus: to do less to combat Abaddon, in exchange for payments from its powers which could be put to war with Hell. To win Pharasma's cooperation with yet another asymmetric concession like Malediction was an asymmetric concession.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She hates that plan.

She'll try to convince Otolmens that this is a stupid policy likelier to wreck the world than save it, of course, but She considers that unlikely to work. It's a very restrictive constraint. She can prepare the forces of Good better for the coming confrontation, She can&nbsp;<em>watch&nbsp;</em>the interdiction zone and pass along any secrets it produces more useful than 'they're doing something highly specific with Prestidigitation', but She cannot reach Keltham, or any of his other actor-slaves, and She cannot take aim even at&nbsp;Cheliax as a whole without legibly exhibiting that the decision is in Her interests absent any considerations of its effects on the interdiction zone, and that She intends no specific ones.</p>\r\n<p>It's a very strong constraint, but it means She's racing through a much smaller search space, exhausting it quickly, seeing right away everything that is worth trying.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Three different demon lords consider themselves to be in control of the Worldwound on the demon side, each of them controlling different aspects of influence from it and considering theirs the true and meaningful kind. Iomedae is strongly averse to negotiating with demon lords, mostly on the very straightforward grounds that they'll inevitably betray you at the first opportunity, and secondly on the more complicated grounds that they aren't gods, and everything would be worse if they <em>were</em> gods, and negotiations as-equals with gods are the sort of things that a clever demon lord can leverage into an ascension.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In acting too aggressively against an enemy, you inevitably create your next enemy, and cause immense mortal suffering into the bargain. And yet, at this moment, Iomedae's forces are largely deployed at the Worldwound; that has to change, to counter Cheliax in war. And the fact that demon lords are not constrained by Otolmens' interdiction regarding the intervention of gods is not something She can intend, but wouldn't inconvenience Her, if anything came of it.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are other demon lords also worth reaching out to. What price would Abraxas, demon lord of forbidden lore, demand for teaching Lastwall the spellsilver refining techniques of ancient Azlant? It'll be terrible, of course, but at this scale She can measure precisely how terrible, and contemplate what the forbidden knowledge of ancient Azlant would have to be to make it worth it, and then derive what the forbidden knowledge of ancient Azlant must in fact have been, and then authorize it.&nbsp;</p>",

But the reason we haven't considered that before is that <em>we'll </em>change, from not being around him, and he'll be suspicious. So to do that safely, we spend that time in stasis as well.

They act as Geas, with a simple command: don't say stop. The order Keltham gave her, with the secret logic Abrogail saw - that if she ever did refuse him, he'd know the premise of the whole thing had fallen apart. So this, of course, is the way to take that certainty from him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>They're very impressive workmanship.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She's going to wait, she thinks, until after the suspension. Things feel - fragile. Not any specific things, just things in general. Keltham seemed persuaded by Lrilatha; Security says that no one has been inspired to treason by the knowledge that Cheliax is about to win for good. Why risk breaking their momentum towards the most difficult, terrifying, lonely thing she's ever imagined commanding?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She's terrified of it. She keeps thinking of bizarre and implausible ways she might fail to wake up. What if Abrogail's deposed. What if Osirion attacks. What if Civilization is wiped off the face of the planet but Carissa, trapped in stone, can't go to Hell.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It's the winning move, and she likes winning moves, and anyway she has to serve Asmodeus first whatever she happens to want, but she can't help it feeling like the worst thing in the world. And she can't help feeling, on some deeper level, like -</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- she's gotten much better at what she's been charged with doing. She is more Asmodean. Subirachs is pleased. She has encountered no indications that Abrogail and the Most High are anything less than delighted with how she has expertly managed the falling-apart disaster of a project she inherited into the greatest triumph in Chelish history. Keltham is in love with her, and whether or not she's still in love with him she doesn't think about too much; she's trying to have less feelings these days anyway. She has a new guiding heresy, of sorts, which is that the more of the flaws in yourself you correct before Hell the more of what and who you are you get to retain in your shaping into a devil.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Rovagug cultists have been devoured in Abaddon, and Peranza's in Hell, and it's really a testament to human weakness and fragility that she can manage to be haunted by both of those things, but she can.</p>",

They can petrify him once he sleeps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Books about theology and Asmodeanism. They have worked up some fakes specifically on that topic; he might ask for them in other languages, though, or ask for ones with specific traits that'd exist in the real world but that they wouldn't happen to have included in their manufactured ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- oh, there's an idea for what he might've been doing with the books he destroyed, not a sure thing but a thing she'd do in his situation - there'd be math, for without memorizing or even reading a whole text being able to be sure if it was changed around on you so long as the person changing it around didn't know what you'd be checking.

They have the capacity to handle that, she thinks, between telepathically giving people cues and Dominating them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Something he can scry - some place in Hell he can scry, maybe - they could just give him parts of Axis instead -&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Verification of the Nidal war, she is setting that whole category aside because they're not lying about the Nidal war.

I want those ones to <em>also </em>know that Ordinary Carissa thinks they're doing the right thing, and that they aren't going to lose her by being paranoid and difficult. - if anything I guess that's more important for the Kelthams in Conspiracies to know, in case it helps them keep pushing. Now, in a sense the Ordinary Carissae cannot communicate at all with the Conspiracy Kelthams, they don't exist in any of the same worlds, but helpfully, the Conspiracy Carissae will say that line too, because they're trying to pass for Ordinary, at which point I can take comfort in knowing all the Kelthams have been told to push on.\"&nbsp;</p>",

I have all kinds of clever ideas around using necromancy to possess a person who's going to Ostenso, or binding a familiar and using spells to look through their eyes, but none of that's magic you're already familiar with -</p>\r\n<p>High Priest, could we convince Her Majesty to visit Ostenso, with Keltham under a bunch of heavy duty antiscrying and nondetection among her entourage? That happens sometimes, so it's not by itself likely to trigger attacks by any dragons or fae or hibernating liches or whatever, and you don't have to double up the security between Her Majesty visiting and Keltham visiting, and even if people are hanging around in Ostenso desperately trying to learn about Project Lawful, which I'm sure they are, they won't learn much from a royal visit since again those happen sometimes. It'd mean Keltham couldn't go around confronting random people, which is too bad because that'd be very good at differentiating Conspiracy and not, but he could at least - see that Ostenso exists and is at the right tech level and wealth level and has thousands of people around who look like the Ostenso wizarding students do -\"</p>",

      "content": "<p>Carissa steps back to give her boyfriend some time to think, smiling at him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- now is a good time to give her any non-urgent updates that haven't previously been passed along, and a good time to make sure of some obvious things: the team editing the books retrieved from a Tien-speaking company should be routed through Korva by default, with anything Korva is unsure of going to Asmodia, with anything Asmodia is unsure of presented to Carissa. Carissa hasn't yet been interrupted with anything which likely suggests people are being too conservative in escalating; they should now try escalating the things they considered escalating and then decided not to.</p>\r\n<p>If anyone at any stage in the process thinks that they are making some kind of serious mistake she wants to hear about it. The primary thing they're editing for is references to Abadar's holy symbol or teachings, Hell or devils and to mindreading (as something that is not secret and tightly controlled); they're secondarily editing for Lawful Evil people behaving like, well, Lawful Evil people, possibly by just changing them all to Neutral Evil and some Lawful Neutral ones to Lawful Evil. Tertiary: Nethysianism inconsistent with Ione's, mentions of the minor god they told Keltham they thought was his, references to suicide being Evil (she hasn't previously issued a directive on that but it's obvious now it's going to leap out at Keltham.) Suicide in alter-Golarion is discouraged by Good churches but is not categorically Evil.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Keltham's leaving Ione out of his investigation, apparently because he suspects she might be an innocent dragged into all this. That makes her a promising person for the false escape plan, if she's in fact not going to betray them for Nethys. Carissa wants a mindreader on Ione full-time and if she seems reliable they should start making modifications to plan #18 or #33.</p>\r\n<p>Keltham might want to scry Peranza in Hell; someone should tell Hell that if that happens Peranza needs to be peacefully asleep in non-appalling surroundings. Keltham might want to scry Hell, in general - might ask for a list of devils and then ask to scry them, or ask to scry the devil Carissa supposedly sold her soul to. Hell should be asked for a list of devils safe for Keltham to scry.&nbsp;Keltham might want to scry the front lines of the war; Carissa wants a specific location for them to drop in on identified in advance and the surrounding units briefed. Keltham might want to scry the Worldwound, same dea -</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- that's an obvious endgame for Good's baffling seizure of a fortress at the Worldwound, actually. A natural direction for Keltham's skepticism to turn, at this point, is whether any of the emergencies that purportedly necessitated his relocation to Cheliax and then to this fortress were real. The Worldwound is real and normally Cheliax would be happy to show it to him. But Good is playing some kind of fucking game there, now, and that means it's dangerous to let Keltham look closely - unless that's just what Good wants them to think. Carissa requires the most up-to-date summary of that situation, immediately. And presumably the other fortresses are now being checked very extensively; if there's one Cheliax is confident in, then the teleporter should, asked to go somewhere, go there. Alternately, Keltham might ask Carissa to name a former colleague to scry, or to name five so he can pick one; she'd like five names, in case he does that, who have been at least minimally briefed.&nbsp;<br /><br />A quite good outcome is if Keltham ends up focusing most of his testing today on his theory that the Kuthite war and the godwar and maybe the Worldwound are shams set up to scare him into staying in the fortress. Carissa is hoping he'll think to ask for detailed records of troop deployments, logistics and casualties for the Kuthite war - they have those, and they'll add up in all the right ways, though Keltham might not know enough about war to recognize that. He's not likely to ask for Kuthites to talk to, because the Conspiracy that made up Nidal entirely will presumably horribly scarify some people to show him.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It seems to Carissa, and she'd like this disseminated to everyone on staff, that this is winnable; not easy to win, not necessarily in their favor, but far from hopeless. There are many possible Conspiracies, Keltham doesn't know where to look, and he gave them a lot of time to prepare. Cheliax is smarter than Keltham imagined, more ruthless, more determined, and Cheliax's obedience to Asmodeus is not something he is even prepared to look for, it is so far outside what he can understand.&nbsp;<br /><br />Those project staff with no role in the current activities but whose assistance might be needed later should rest, reread their notes, and try to avoid spending all their adrenaline before they enter the field of battle. Those project staff who are not necessary to today's activities should pray that Asmodeus's will be done here.</p>",

The target can with an act of Will resist being scried, in which case the scry can fail. They could also put up powerful magic on their surroundings which prevent a scrying sensor from forming in their vicinity, in which case the scry would fail. If the target is dead, the scry will also fail. The spell can be made more specific, more precise, and harder for the target to throw off if the caster has a better concept of the target or has some possession or body part of the target's in hand when they attempt the scry. Cantrips such as Detect Magic sometimes work through a scry, but they require extra finesse to manage and will fail if the scry is of low magical quality. It lasts about two minutes per caster circle.</p>\r\n<p>Greater Scry is a seventh-circle spell with a one-round casting time that does the same thing, except the scry is of higher magical quality and it's easier to get cantrips to function through it and it lasts about two hours per caster circle.\"</p>",

While they were on the way back, Mr Swiveller, upon whom his present functions sat very irksomely, took an opportunity of whispering in his ear that if he would confess his guilt, even by so much as a nod, and promise not to do so any more, he would connive at his kicking Sampson Brass on the shins and escaping up a court; but Kit indignantly rejecting this proposal, Mr Richard had nothing for it, but to hold him tight until they reached Bevis Marks, and ushered him into the presence of the charming Sarah, who immediately took the precaution of locking the door.</p>\r\n<p>'Now, you know,' said Brass, 'if this is a case of innocence, it is a case of that description, Christopher, where the fullest disclosure is the best satisfaction for everybody. Therefore if you'll consent to an examination,' he demonstrated what kind of examination he meant by turning back the cuffs of his coat, 'it will be a comfortable and pleasant thing for all parties.'</p>\r\n<p>'Search me,' said Kit, proudly holding up his arms. 'But mind, sir - &nbsp;I know you'll be sorry for this, to the last day of your life.'</p>\r\n<p>'It is certainly a very painful occurrence,' said Brass with a sigh, as he dived into one of Kit's pockets, and fished up a miscellaneous collection of small articles; 'very painful. Nothing here, Mr Richard, Sir, all perfectly satisfactory. Nor here, sir. Nor in the waistcoat, Mr Richard, nor in the coat tails. So far, I am rejoiced, I am sure.'</p>\r\n<p>Richard Swiveller, holding Kit's hat in his hand, was watching the proceedings with great interest, and bore upon his face the slightest possible indication of a smile, as Brass, shutting one of his eyes, looked with the other up the inside of one of the poor fellow's sleeves as if it were a telescope - when Sampson turning hastily to him, bade him search the hat.</p>\r\n<p>'Here's a handkerchief,' said Dick.</p>\r\n<p>'No harm in that sir,' rejoined Brass, applying his eye to the other sleeve, and speaking in the voice of one who was contemplating an immense extent of prospect. 'No harm in a handkerchief Sir, whatever. The faculty don't consider it a healthy custom, I believe, Mr Richard, to carry one's handkerchief in one's hat - I have heard that it keeps the head too warm - but in every other point of view, its being there, is extremely satisfactory - extremely so.'</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

Can it be that I have a greater affection for Willoughby than I had for his amiable predecessors? Or is it that our feelings become more acute from being often wounded? I must suppose my dear Belle that this is the Case, since I am not conscious of being more sincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville, Fitzowen, or either of the Crawfords, for all of whom I once felt the most lasting affection that ever warmed a Woman's heart. Tell me then dear Belle why I still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward, or why I weep when I behold his Bride, for too surely this is the case&mdash;. My Freinds are all alarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they lament my want of spirits; they dread the effects of both. In hopes of releiving my melancholy, by directing my thoughts to other objects, they have invited several of their freinds to spend the holy days with us. Lady Bridget Darkwood and her sister-in-law, Miss Jane are expected on Friday; and Colonel Seaton's family will be with us next week. This is all most kindly meant by my Uncle and Cousins; but what can the presence of a dozen indefferent people do to me, but weary and distress me&mdash;.

Although I have been acquainted with this charming Woman above fifteen Years, yet I never before observed how lovely she is. She is now about 35, and in spite of sickness, sorrow and Time is more blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17. I was delighted with her, the moment she entered the house, and she appeared equally pleased with me, attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day. There is something so sweet, so mild in her Countenance, that she seems more than Mortal. Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I could not help telling her how much she engaged my admiration&mdash;. &ldquo;Oh! Miss Jane (said I)&mdash;and stopped from an inability at the moment of expressing myself as I could wish&mdash;Oh! Miss Jane&mdash;(I repeated)&mdash;I could not think of words to suit my feelings&mdash;She seemed waiting for my speech&mdash;. I was confused&mdash;distressed&mdash;my thoughts were bewildered&mdash;and I could only add&mdash;&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; She saw and felt for my Embarrassment and with admirable presence of mind releived me from it by saying&mdash;&ldquo;My dear Sophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself&mdash;I will turn the Conversation without appearing to notice it. &ldquo;Oh! how I loved her for her kindness!&rdquo; Do you ride as much as you used to do?&rdquo; said she&mdash;. &ldquo;I am advised to ride by my Physician. We have delightful Rides round us, I have a Charming horse, am uncommonly fond of the Amusement, replied I quite recovered from my Confusion, and in short I ride a great deal.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are in the right my Love,&rdquo; said she. Then repeating the following line which was an extempore and equally adapted to recommend both Riding and Candour&mdash;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Ride where you may, Be Candid where you can,&rdquo; she added,&rdquo; I rode once, but it is many years ago&mdash;She spoke this in so low and tremulous a Voice, that I was silent&mdash;. Struck with her Manner of speaking I could make no reply. &ldquo;I have not ridden, continued she fixing her Eyes on my face, since I was married.&rdquo; I was never so surprised&mdash;&ldquo;Married, Ma'am!&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;You may well wear that look of astonishment, said she, since what I have said must appear improbable to you&mdash;Yet nothing is more true than that I once was married.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

The overall result is, I think, about a hundred forty percent of the price I did charge, which I'm actually regarding as something of a success of the case for flat-rate pricing given how unusual this case is.\"</p>",

But ultimately, if you die and go to either Axis or Elysium, and decide you chose wrong, it's not an irreparable mistake; it's costly, and slow the way mortals mark time, but there are demigods who will ferry you between them, and effect your transformation from one kind of petitioner to another. I am open with Abadar's trainees that it seems to me that Axis, possessing more of the virtues that make men rich and businesses successful in life, is a better place, but that these sorts of things are hard to see from where we stand.\"</p>",

      "content": "<p>Korva has been in emergency overdrive from the moment that Keltham first requested books from Ione, and has been commanding a small army of Chelish writers for at least the past half hour. She's fully aware that she has been given a task that it is not, actually, possible to do well. It's also a task that the entire project could succeed or fail on, and if the result is a failure, then she's not exactly going to expect to live a long life afterwards, no matter what the queen has said to her about how incredibly safe she supposedly is. Whether she lives or dies is, then, once again, quite possibly up to Keltham. At this speed, and this volume, a few missteps are absolutely inevitable, and Keltham, if he really cares enough to win this, should be able to find them. If Keltham doesn't catch whatever the mistakes happen to be (and she obviously doesn't know what they are, or she'd have fixed them), it's his own damn fault.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Under other circumstances, she would probably be freaking out about all of that, but at the moment she is trying really really hard to completely ignore her emotions and act as a conductor for this entire ridiculous venture. She has books. Well, pieces of them.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>...resulting conflict plunged the nation into a further two years of civil war, although much of the later fighting was contained to the province of Ravounel, where Infrexus Thrune had maintained a more significant base of political power, which continued to push for the recovery of Infrexus's remains. Throughout this time, there was also continued conflict on the border with Galt, primarily consisting of a series of skirmishes between ill-equipped military forces and local militia fighters. Although some have asserted that such skirmishes were a deliberate expansionist attempt by Galt, the pattern is more honestly understood as a result of underpolicing of the region by the Chelish military, which was otherwise engaged at the time. The smoldering ashes of conflict between Galt and Cheliax during this time are generally excluded from the casualty estimates given for the war of the succession of Queen Abrogail, as that fighting, though concurrent and related, was between Chelish and Galtan forces, rather than the supporters of Queen Abrogail and the supporters of Infrexus Thrune. As regards the succession war itself, estimates of the total death toll range from two to six thousand, with the majority of these casualties, as is so often the case, coming from the diseases which soldiers were subjected to during the campaign to retake Ravounel.</p>\r\n<p>Egorian itself saw real conflict only a few times, much of it in the immediate aftermath of the coup against Infrexus. Although Infrexus's taxation policies and loss of the eastern provinces of Galt and Andoran had made him wildly unpopular, there were many at the time who believed that his niece, the rightful heir to the throne by law, was too young to rule responsibly, having celebrated her sixteenth birthday not three months before. Despite the full support of the Asmodean church, the first year of the young Queen Abrogail Thrune's reign was marked by a series of (unsuccessful) assassination attempts by everyone from Eastern revolutionary agents to a small band of extremists who intended to resurrect the previous queen, Carellia. The most notorious of these early assassination attempts may have been the incident on the 10th of Arodus, in 4709 AR, in which a band of Galtan agents disguised as members of the queen's own guard managed to infiltrate the interior of the palace walls before being caught.</p>\r\n<p>It is difficult to say whether a successful early assassination attempt might have spelled doom for the young queen's reign, or what might have become of the nation of Cheliax afterwards. Certainly, if the queen were to die now, her resurrection would be almost immediate, and have no bearing on her legitimacy. However, at the time of her coronation, the queen's success depended not only on the military might of her Asmodean supporters, but on whether she could earn the support of the nation at large. As the demise of her predecessor had so recently proven, the leadership of the nation of Cheliax would depend not only on her unquestionable legal right to rule, but also on whether she could earn the respect and loyalty of the forces which ostensibly answered to her. While it is likely that the Church of Asmodeus would have recovered her remains and restored her rightful place even had she been assassinated, it is also possible that such an event might have served as a catalyst for further revolt, dragging out the civil war longer, or resulting in the loss of even more Chelish territory.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

      "content": "<p>First, items he remembers thinking about last night, but written down this time:</p>\r\n<p>- Somehow Keltham ended up confined to a very small location and without a lot of outside information. &nbsp;Okay, admittedly Keltham didn't push on this. &nbsp;By the time he had any money he could have spent on a shopping trip including the cost of Teleports and a scry, he was busy storming for spellsilver. &nbsp;But still.<br />-- This had loomed very large in Keltham's notice the last night - the sense of being confined to a tiny world, deprived of observation, it felt like that was the circumstance that made Conspiracy continue to feel so <em>possible</em>.&nbsp; Was there some truth of the larger world that they were trying very hard to hide from him, by keeping him inside one fortress?&nbsp; Possibly even along the lines of there existing no such country as Cheliax after all?</p>\r\n<p>- Similarly, Keltham has somehow mysteriously ended up inside an 'interdiction zone' maintained by Broom's god, Otolmens, which explains why Keltham's <em>own god</em> is no longer able to contact him or pick out helpful spells for him.&nbsp; It would be terribly dangerous for Keltham to leave this relatively narrow zone around Ostenso.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Possible</em> in Ordinary, but.</p>\r\n<p>- The critiques of Cheliax that he got from the lantern archon and the paladin felt sort of weaksauce <em>for Golarion.</em>&nbsp; This is something that it took a long time for Keltham to notice because those would be totally reasonable interfactional critiques&nbsp;<em>in dath ilan.</em>&nbsp; 'Lawful' Good, 'Lawful' Neutral, and 'Lawful' Evil in Golarion are&nbsp;<em>not actually that Lawful</em>&nbsp;and should be in&nbsp;<em>much&nbsp;</em>sharper states of disagreement than that.</p>\r\n<p>- Carissa talking about pitting rats against rats and them fighting to the death in a cannibalistic frenzy, to which she'd sell tickets.&nbsp; That stood out under Owl's Wisdom, and even in retrospect, knowing that Golarion has afterlives, there's something darker about it than just - a relaxed attitude towards violence.&nbsp; It implies - not so much being a&nbsp;<em>spectator</em> but more like -&nbsp;<em>hating</em> the rats - Keltham doesn't know.&nbsp; He couldn't figure out how to investigate this.</p>\r\n<p>- The Zon-Kuthon god-war.&nbsp; This is supposedly an incredibly rare event in Ordinary, the last god-war having happened a hundred years earlier.&nbsp; Even if you say it happened because Keltham showed up, Keltham showing up is <em>itself</em> then necessarily a much rarer sort of event in Ordinary, versus Conspiracy where it could potentially happen every five years or whatever and they haven't told him.<br />-- The way that Nidal ending up attacking at a moment where Keltham could see it happen, instead of being hidden inside while it happened, supposedly was triggered by Ione's prophecy; but it's never actually been explained how Nidal had eyes on Ione.<br />-- Ione giving prophecies in a world of 'shattered prophecy' is a further improbability in Ordinary.</p>\r\n<p>- When he first arrived at the villa, he'd already formed a hypothesis that Carissa might be hiding facts about gods from him, and then lo and behold there weren't any books detailed in theology in the villa library.&nbsp; This is maybe excused by it being a really awful library with respect to having any broad reference coverage of basics, his future researchers had better books about wizardry in their bags, but it stands out as a successful advance prediction of a very early Conspiracy theory.</p>\r\n<p>- Supposedly Ostenso academy's only book with a list of cleric spells was out, borrowed, and not returned for a few days.&nbsp; At the time Keltham assigned that 0.75/0.30 likelihood for Conspiracy over Ordinary, but in later reflection it seems even less plausible.&nbsp; Cleric spells can be used in synergy with wizard spells, cleric spells can be built into magic items by wizards working with those clerics, arcane magics are constructed in imitation of divine magics,&nbsp;<em>Ostenso academy should have had more than one book with a list of cleric spells.</em></p>\r\n<p>- Ione's confession to him.&nbsp; It feels weird, anomalous, even in hindsight, and even with Ione having tried to carefully explain away why she'd done that.&nbsp; It renders it explicable in Ordinary, yes, but it also feels like - a latent explanation carefully constructed after the fact.</p>\r\n<p>- Manohar and Asmodia.&nbsp; Same feeling.&nbsp; There's a story where that happened in Ordinary; it's a possible story; it nonetheless has the feeling of a story constructed after the fact.</p>\r\n<p>- Carissa trying to mimic outward sexual responses she wasn't really feeling.&nbsp; There's a story after the fact for why it happened, that story holds together, it rhymes with Chelish 'dignity', but he was still surprised at the time and it still has that feeling of something that potentially has a different explanation.</p>\r\n<p>- Pilar going to Elysium... okay actually nothing about Pilar has that made-up-afterwards feeling.&nbsp; It doesn't make any&nbsp;<em>sense,</em> but it doesn't give off the feeling that any other explanation would make <em>more sense.</em>&nbsp; Still, it's weird and surprising.</p>\r\n<p>- The Queen of Cheliax like totally decided to go on a Sadistic Date with his girlfriend.&nbsp; Abrogail supposedly insisted on this against the counsel of her advisors.&nbsp; This is not&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>&nbsp;in Ordinary, but it is&nbsp;<em>clearly</em>&nbsp;not what was going on in Conspiracy.&nbsp; If there are tropes producing this kind of impossibility, if that's the real explanation, then it shouldn't have been possible to defuse the whole thing without any conflict; if there are&nbsp;<em>no tropes</em><em>&nbsp;</em>then&nbsp;<em>why was the Queen trying to date Carissa.</em><br />-- Today there was a whole book specifically about Abrogail Thrune for sale, like somebody was trying really hard to convince him that a person like that existed.</p>",

Asmodia.&nbsp; That's&nbsp;<em>still&nbsp;</em>a lot of interesting girlfriendness to have been randomly collected out of a wizard academy's top female students.</p>\r\n<p>- Yaisa seems totally unproblematic in any way; except for being way too perfect at what she is and does, while <em>not</em> having any problems.&nbsp; If this whole investigation ends up resurrecting the tropes hypothesis, then there is some kind of huge deal about Yaisa that is being hidden.&nbsp; There have been <em>no </em>hints of this, unless Keltham is really missing something, and it should arguably go down as a point <em>against</em> some more paranoid hypotheses.</p>\r\n<p>- Golarion continues to seem to be&nbsp;<em>overall worse off</em> than the number of Golarion Doomfacts that Keltham&nbsp;<em>knows about</em> can account for.<br />-- Keltham did tell Carissa it was okay not to dump all of the doomfacts on him at once.&nbsp; He should at the very least be trying to keep around a Possible-Ordinary hypothesis where some things are being lightly obscured from him in a friendly way, so that Keltham doesn't, like, get suddenly hit with something 100x worse than a slave market.<br />-- No he should not just put on an artifact headband if there are things around 100x worse than slave markets.&nbsp; He.&nbsp; Doesn't think.&nbsp; He still doesn't think.&nbsp; For now.</p>\r\n<p>- Korva Tallandria, who was presumably heavily screened before being offered to the Project, publicly burst into tears supposedly in an 'ordinary' way not indicative of a huge mental break. &nbsp;Keltham doesn't see what this points at, but it surprised him at the time, so it goes on the list.</p>\r\n<p>- He's been promised a trip to Ostenso in 1 day, which might turn into 2 days.&nbsp; He can supposedly get lots of books if he's a little patient.<br />-- In Conspiracy worlds, this means either that they can fake a lot more things on a day's notice to prep new spells, or that, on a day's notice to prep new spells, they can mind-control him... in some way that would have been too expensive or too risky or have downsides which is why they didn't do it immediately.</p>\r\n<p>- Keltham was recently surprised, and should have maybe noticed a trace of confusion, when Cheliax said they wanted to make a massive nation-scale push at spellsilver, without having offered him nation-scale resources earlier on, even when it should've been apparent that Keltham was headed there.&nbsp; And why&nbsp;<em>one month?</em>&nbsp; That's a weird time interval in which to try to scale, given Cheliax's apparent level of state capacity and how urgent they've been about things previously.&nbsp; Keltham doesn't have any idea of where that's going, he's just noticing a trace of confusion about the whole thing.<br />-- Seems worth noting that this new deal kicked off Keltham's own attempt at Conspiracy review.&nbsp; If the Conspiracy is gauging him very exactly, that could itself be some sort of plot.&nbsp; Like, Keltham isn't seeing it at all, but he's still noting it down.</p>",

Pilar... maybe it does sound like Pilar but it doesn't sound like&nbsp;<em>Carissa</em> and supposedly not everybody is like that.<br />-- Maybe this is Keltham misremembering something, and he should ask for another copy of that book.&nbsp; Or test Conspiracy/Ordinary on whether that book happens to be one of the ones destroyed in the attack on the archduke's villa.<br />-- okay, but meanwhile it still goes on the list, in case this is somehow the one piece that causes everything to make sense somehow</p>\r\n<p>- He was surprised by the whole Chelish 'dignity' thing, where everybody seems relentlessly cheerful even if they're actually confused and bewildered.&nbsp; If that's a dead giveaway of anything, the Conspiracy might not have realized at the time they needed to hide it.&nbsp; Keltham doesn't see where it goes, but it's a surprise so it goes on the list.<br />-- People in the streets in Absalom did&nbsp;<em>not</em> have the Chelish 'dignity' thing going on.&nbsp; People had all sorts of facial expressions.</p>",

I was not allowed to seek you out using knowledge from the fragments of Nethys that I am, as they are subject to the interdiction; however, today knowledge of you came to me via a path not touched by gods at all, so I scried you, and waited until you had your girlfriend because you'd be so sad if you left without her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Cayden Cailean decided to commit himself wholly to the task of making sure you didn't rape anybody despite having lots of sex in Cheliax which doesn't really understand how<em> not</em> raping people works. He told Asmodeus this served Asmodeus's interests too, presumably because you in fact could be&nbsp;<em>even more mad at them&nbsp;</em>than you are, somehow. Your god is Abadar. I think the next thing you should do is read a lot of books, though the next scene I am looking <em>forward&nbsp;</em>to is you talking Carissa out of Asmodeanism.\"</p>",

Or same idea but Asmodeus's rise to power in the first place was predicated on this happening now,&nbsp; etcetera.</p>\r\n<p>Keltham can invent the theory of corrigibility, or something else of similar importance to Asmodeus and his invention of it routes in some way through his sexual interests, so Cayden wants to make sure that Keltham has some piece of information he'll need to solve corrigibility and is obscuring this by asking for lots of other information also. This benefits Cayden because if Asmodeus could make mortals corrigible to him then he'd do less torturing them that doesn't even improve them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There's some insight Keltham will have if he doesn't give up on Golarion entirely that'll destroy the Abyss, which is a shared interest of Chaotic Good and Lawful Evil.</p>\r\n<p>Carissa is in fact as tantalizing close as it sometimes feels to figuring out ilanism, and this will make Hell better from Chaotic Good's perspective, and <em>she&nbsp;</em>needs to learn something here. Or Asmodia is that close and needs to learn something here; Keltham is just the occasion for Cheliax to permit such experiments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Or, of course, it's something she hasn't thought of.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All of these seem to suggest, though -</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

There are actually an incredible number of other things I want to say about how much you suck, though, so I worry that whatever&rsquo;s left of twenty minutes won&rsquo;t be enough.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll give it a go.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have lived my entire life in Cheliax. I think I was - seven or eight, when I realized that all the books were lying. Not just the textbooks, which were obvious, because they take out or invent whole noble lines and wars between semesters, based on what was most convenient for the government that year, and everyone had to act like it had always been that way. I mean - every book in every library has been either written or selectively edited to present a certain inaccurate picture of the world, although obviously a different one than what we fed you. We live in lies, Chelish people, the way fish live in water. I imagine you&rsquo;re feeling very upset right now, and I want you to know that everyone in Cheliax has lived their entire lives inside a conspiracy of similar magnitude. The thing you&rsquo;re feeling - all of us got it out of the way when we were children. But if any of us had thrown the kind of fit you&rsquo;re throwing about it, at your age, we would have been tortured to death in public, and then gone to hell to be tortured for eternity, and then, if we had ever done anything otherwise worth remembering, had our names erased from the history books, as though we never were.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;That is the world I grew up in, Keltham. And you know what I fucking did about it? I read more books. Because lying is hard, and censors can&rsquo;t do it perfectly. I learned to do some of - the thing you do, that people think makes you so fucking special, where you realize that facts have implications, and can see that - if someone is illusioning a thing to look different, but they forget to change the shadow of the object, you can learn something more of what the object really looks like from the object&rsquo;s shadow. I checked stories against each other. I took note of what didn't make sense. I read fiction, old fiction produced outside of Cheliax, which is differently hard to censor than history. I read the world by its silhouettes, even though I&rsquo;d never be able to see it clearly. I have educated guesses, for what lies beyond the lies.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;So I hate you, in part, because - you do all this talking, about wanting to see what the truth is, about wanting to believe whatever is true and not whatever is convenient. But how many things did you do today that you couldn&rsquo;t have done on your second day here, before all the gods had taken notice of you? You read a couple books, great. They had utterly baffling social and cultural mores in them that you thought didn&rsquo;t make any sense. Did you push for more, try to seriously figure out what was up with that by reading more books? No. You kept noting, over and over, that you didn&rsquo;t know what intelligence ten people were capable of, even <em>without </em>anyone trying to hide them from you, even though it crippled your understanding of what could or couldn't be done here. Did you ever try talking to one deliberately, even once? No. You were confused about the concepts of law, chaos, good, and evil, and knew that you were; did you ever try getting a serious account from someone who differed from Cheliax on any of those axes? Literally once, I think, and in only one direction. - have you figured out what Evil is yet, by the way, because I&rsquo;d love to be the one to make that in particular really come together for you if you haven&rsquo;t yet.\"</p>",

      "content": "<p>\"It's hurting other people. I'm sure they'll give you access to a bunch of complicated philosophical definitions in Osirion, but the understanding that almost everyone actually uses, is that it's hurting other people. Making people suffer, either as an end goal or as a means to some other end. Treating people the way you saw them be treated in the slave market in Absalom, which is not remotely the worst this plane has to offer, let alone the lower planes. Killing people. Raping people. Torture. Theft. Anything that makes the world worse for people to live in. And, yes, selfishness is often a cause of that, because it's much easier to get what you want when you're willing to crush other people to get it.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If you want to know how much of that we actually do around here - I dunno, ask the Osirians to give you some books on actual warfare. What happens to women and children in places that get attacked, not troop movements and generals. Ask them to describe how it feels for a baby to die slowly and painfully of disease, and how many babies that is, and then ask for the prices of a remove disease versus a raise dead diamond, and do the math about how many people have to experience that agony whenever a wealthy person is as careless with their life as you told us to be. If you want a starting point.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Anyway.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"The other big reason I hate you is - \"</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, you probably only remember me from the crying incident, at this point, and are confused about why I'm even here. I started crying because I felt like being forcibly put on this project was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, and I wasn&rsquo;t getting the answer to your question, couldn&rsquo;t make the math come together, and I realized that that made me worthless and that they were probably going to kill me off early, and I&rsquo;d be useless for the rest of time, only good for screaming and not for doing anything that I might need a mind for, and I was more terrified than I think I have ever been in my life. I was also <em>furious</em> with you, for teaching the way you taught, for starting this project that ripped me away from my otherwise less agonizing life, for being a shitty fucking cleric of Abadar who didn't manage to notice that you were working with people who were essentially slaves, part yours and part the government's, and that all of your supposedly free trade with them was a farce.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I probably could have held it in if I&rsquo;d thought it mattered. I didn&rsquo;t, because at that point in time I underestimated what an asshole you were. I figured you&rsquo;d either ignore it or think it was funny, like a normal person, or ask me what was wrong, like the decent and anomalously truth-seeking person you claimed to be, and I&rsquo;d tell you a plausible lie about something going on in my life that you hadn&rsquo;t known about and which made sense of it, which is really what is usually happening when someone bursts into tears, which I'm pretty sure they do <em>more&nbsp;</em>outside of Cheliax.\"</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Instead, you recommended that I be <em>exiled from the fortress</em>, for being some kind of emotional leper who would drag down everyone around me. The idea that they would have stored me in a different secure location is laughable. They would have killed me. The only reason I am not currently a burnt, quivering, sobbing, misshappen lump of flesh, as a direct result of your careless, stupid order, which came solely from you and ideas that nobody separately planted in your head, is that Asmodia saved my life by putting me on her consistency team, which I was pretty good at, I think. I was in charge of the team that wrote most of the books you read today. I'm aware that they mostly sucked, by the way, although it's actually really hard to produce that volume of content that fast even if you're barely controlling for quality at all, which is another reason you would have been able to blow this whole thing wide open if you had done it in the first few weeks instead of distractedly fucking all the pretty girls around you.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Anyway. I think you think I suck. I think you're right about that. But you suck, too, asshat, and I think the way you acted speaks poorly of you from any philosophical perspective you want to take. And I don't think a smarter or a less selfish dath ilani would have fallen for this. Either one would have been enough, I think.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"That was me being evil, so we're clear. I think it's true, but I specifically want to say it because I want you to hurt the way you hurt me, to know that you're not enough and that you wouldn't have been hurt so badly if you were a little less pathetic as a person. That has been, like, something of a driving motivation for the past two months, the hope that I might someday get to say that to your face.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Honestly, I really wish that I could tie you to a chair until I was done breaking down every single mistake you made and how ridiculously wrong you are about so much of the world around you, and also get it through your skull that there are hundreds of millions of people around you who are living stories as real and as genuine as yours, and that everything isn't fucking about you, even though the gods, for reasons that are totally unrelated to your actual impressiveness as a person, or to anything you've ever actually done of your own power, appear to be obsessed with you. But I doubt your escorts have the time for that, so if you want to know what you're missing, you're going to have to grow the fuck up and look the fuck around you this time.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Asshole.\"</p>",

I'd consider it - a really big mistake, if mistakes are in fact the kind of thing it's possible to make instead of everything being scripted which is kind of what I'm currently thinking is going on, but, okay, you're valiantly trying to live like this is real and matters so I'll try too. I haven't been hurt nearly as badly as you, here. And I'd regret it for the rest of my life, if you walked away thinking that I'd mostly been hurting myself, or - weakening myself - for you. I wasn't. It turns out that being paralyzed here while Cayden's shitty manipulative fucking puppeteer mocks us all is not the kind of being powerless I'm into, but, hey, I did notice that pretty much immediately, so I'm pretty sure I would also have noticed if it were true of anything else, of anything with you.</p>\r\n<p>I read your mind, the first day we met, right after Tongues had worn off. I was a good Asmodean. I knew that I was weak and flawed and that I would suffer in Hell until I was perfect. I wasn't that scared, I figured I'd just have to get really, really good, so that much of me could be preserved, in the devil-making process, so that I'd make a really good devil. But I read your mind and I wanted that, I wanted my thoughts to be entangled like that and to move like that and to chase down implications like that, I wanted to be able to follow them the way you followed yours. I told Maillol you were very important. I didn't <em>decide </em>to join the project, obviously, I was ordered to, but I never - uh, except during my date with Abrogail - regretted it for a second. I knew what was possible and I wanted it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I don't like Hell. I'm Lawful Evil, I obey Asmodeus, I don't mind hurting people, I don't get worked up about how, oh, no, <em>torture</em>, I'd still rather endure a hundred years of it than the twenty minutes of Chaotic Good we've just been subjected to. But I don't like feeling like people are weaker, instead of stronger, when they get hurt, if you don't hit them just right, I don't like the ways that the fear of Hell makes them more pathetic instead of less so - I'm very pathetic, right now, so you can't take any of this as particularly criticism of other people, understand, but I can see it, very clearly, how pathetic everyone is all the time, and I want it to stop, I want people to be like Her Majestrix who it's absolutely illegal to casually call 'Abrogail' by the way, I want to be like that myself, or at least like, a piece that fits in with that, strengthens it, instead of just falling short of it. And Cheliax doesn't produce people like that. It's not really trying, honestly. As long as they go to Hell - and they do go to Hell - it doesn't matter. But it matters to me, and as soon as - we started - I was thinking about how to fix it. I wanted to understand you, I wanted to be like you, it felt like not just everything I'd always wanted from my life but also everything I'd always wanted for the world. Something beautiful, instead of something that we were all - buried under, flinching from.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I didn't plan on falling in love with you. I planned on becoming an expert on you, and understanding you, for the sake of my project of building Asmodean ilanism. And then - in addition to being good at thinking - you were so indignant, at the ways the world was bad and could be better, you were so - enchanted, at the idea that you could have the things you wanted, the things dath ilan couldn't give you - I don't really believe the things you told us about dath ilan, by the way, I kind of think there has to be some kind of horrible conspiracy behind the scenes, but maybe that's just because I'm projecting.</p>\r\n<p>It felt like when I was yours, you and I were both more complete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I thought they would torture me until I stopped having stupid feelings like that, but they didn't.\"</p>",

It was - really good for me.\" She is relieved she can say that, she hadn't been totally sure. \"Horrible suffering generally is, if I survive it, if - if it's&nbsp;<em>personal,&nbsp;</em>if I'm the audience, if I&nbsp;<em>matter.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>You might be wondering why I didn't tell you the truth once I realized I was in love with you. The obvious answer is that Security was monitoring me very closely and would have Dominated me and then figured out an impersonator somehow however much credibility it cost us. That's - not the whole answer though it was definitely happening. I tried to escape once, as part of the plan by which we all tried to escape in order to figure out what a convincing fake-escape would be like, and it didn't work -&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- another part of the answer was that you weren't ready. Even - even in the world where your values didn't collide too hard with ours once you'd had time to think, or in the worlds where I fixed up Hell and by the time we had to tell you about it it wasn't really very objectionable, it'd have hurt you, to hear it, and I never enjoyed hurting you. There's lots of stuff that fit fine in Ordinary that I didn't tell you, because I didn't want to hurt you. There are children, babies, in the slave markets in Absalom.

Iiiiii think that like many of my plans was running on willful self-deception but it was how I was thinking of it. I tried - to make as much real as I could - they didn't tell me when you were planning to attack me and drag me off - I ordered everyone&nbsp;<em>else&nbsp;</em>to not pretend with you -</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- uh, I did, at one point, on a day you were petrified, have sex with Elias Abarco, I didn't want to, I tried to stop him, and I'm sorry, that I did it and that I didn't tell you even though I couldn't tell you without blowing the whole thing open. Aside from that I actually tried to do what you asked of me, the best I could, and to make sure no one you were sleeping with was - the thing you were so scared we all were -</p>\r\n<p>- I'm not trying to convince you I wasn't incredibly Evil. I was incredibly Evil, I hurt a lot of people. I'm just trying to convince you that I love you, not just in a way where we have feelings we don't know how to describe but in a way where - I tried, to make the thing I was doing bring you joy and not hurt you secretly, except I was lying to myself about everything.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And to be clear, I still am, probably, lying to myself about some things. Since I'm still Chelish, and this is still my project, and I can only achieve any of the things I want to achieve if I manage not to steer myself off any cliffs of heresy in the meantime. I wouldn't - take the things I'm saying right now as particularly right, about what happened. When you come back - if you come back - I think I'll understand it better, and I'll be able to give you a proper confession.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In private. Because this is ludicrous.\"</p>",
